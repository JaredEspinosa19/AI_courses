es erfüllt genau die Fantasie die man haten als man als kind die erst Generation gespielen hat 
ein sehr Sehr schönes Pokémon Spiel und auch mal wieder zijn Neues Ist wirklich eine Empfehlung für al Fans 
die Grafik ist nicht sehr gut aber die Story und Das Gameplay machen süchtig und Mann will nur noch grinden 
Ein richtig gute Spiel hervorragen hat nach einer lang zeit mal wieder richtig Spaß macht 
Das Spiel inklusive von den neuen Fängen überzeugt nur die Grafik ist schlecht die Pokemon Animation sind Mega und es macht Spaß die Höhlen und weiten Wiesen zu erkund 
Ich hatte vallen weniger Erwartet als ich mir Pokémon Legenden Arceus vorbestellen haten da im Vorfeld vallen über die Grafik und die Performance gemeckren wrun Und ja mir ist in der Tat aufgefallen dass auch dieser Titel von Game freak wieder die eine oder ander schwäch aufweist Aber Nach kurzer zeit ist Das Schlicht und Einfach Vergessen da Das Spiel Einfach nur abholt und Mitreißt Sei es die Geschichte die ziemlich ausgeklügellen ist denn man landet in einer frühen Version von Sinnoh aus Pokémon Diamant und Perle kleiner Spoiler Eigentlich kommt man aus der Zukunft und Wenn man sichten die kleinen Easter Eggs anschaut Kleidung de Protagonisten zu Beginn des Spiel dann de NPC Hin und die Manaphy Quest welch eigentlich nur zu lösen ist Wenn man Pokémon Strahlender diamant oder Leuchtende Perle gespielen hat dann kommt man Schnell auf den Trichter Ansonsten ist vieles schön umgesetzt ob es nu die Pokémon Weide statt de klassischen Boxen ist die Tatsach dass Pokébälle handgemachten gegenstände sind und alles eben in dies Zeit rein passt oder die musikalisch Untermalung Einfach immer wied an diamant Perle erinnren alles passt Einfach gut zusammen einzig klein Aufgaben nerven wie die Kinoso Nebenquest wo man den Eintrag für Kinoso vervollständigen muss zijn aber nicht wie bisher durch einmaliges Fangen schiehtn sondern Eben wie bei al Pokémon von bestimmt Kriterien abhängen die man erfüll muss wie fang Pokémon mal mal unentdecken nutze diees und jene Attacke Das kann Wenn die Spawnrate eine Pokémon beschissen gering ist und von bestimmt zufälli Faktoren abhängen nervig sein Aber ansonsten ist dieser Titel gefüllt mit Spaß das Jagen von Shinie macht mega vallen Spaß dank der doch hohen Spawnraten 1 128 bei Massenbegegnungen mit schillerpin man hat auch einiges an Sammelkrams für länger Nebenaufgaben wie zum Beispiel Geisterlichter 107 Stück auf 5 welten verteilen damit man am Ende Kryppuk fangen kann oder das Sammeln de komplett Icognito Alphabets zijn ich gut finde ist auch Dass Man nicht Mehr gezwung ist mit ander Spielern zu tauschen um ALLE monster zu bekomm sämtlich durch tausch erhältlichen Entwicklungen kann man nun nämlich bequem mit den jeweilig Gegenständen entwickeln zum Beispiel Metallmantel für Onix um es zu Stahlos zu entwickeln Machomei Simsala Gegner und Co erhält man nun indem man bei Maschock Kadabra Gegner und Co die neu eingeführt Verbindungsschnur nutzt Geile Idee Auch die Bosse die so genannte König mach Spaß Vergleichbar ist Das mit dem System aus Sonne und Mond wo man auch ein Bossmonster bekämpfen mus Trainerkämpfe sind übrigen selten und beschränken sich auf relativ wenig Protagonist aus dem diamant Perl Clan und Einigen ander Charakzer die übrigen auch teilweise vallen Ähnlichkeit zu ihren Nachfahren de Sinnohregion aufweisen Pokémon Legenden Arceus ist ein richtig tolles Spiel Ich bin Jetzt Nach rund 40 Stunden im fünften Gebiet und hoffe sehr Dass wir für die Zukunft noch gute Inhalte bekommen und dass das Endgame an sich interessant wird Bin ja noch nicht Durch 
die grafik sieht aus wie Eine HD version de 3DS Spiele die Texturen sind Sehr Matchig man hat keine ausdauer anzeig weg dem Rennen und man ist nicht in de laag an einem 5 mm Hohen ort zu laufen ohne Das man abrutschten ansonst ist es Eines de best de Reihe seit und Omega und Alpha es ist toll Das Man nicht Mehr geg ein Pokemon Kämpfen muss um es zu fang das Vervollständigen de Pokedex macht Jetzt vallen Mehr Spass und die Story ist sehr gut gemacht Aber sie hätten nicht gleich oft erwähn müss Das Wir vom Himmel gefalel sind 
Contra Die Grafik ist ein riesengroße Frechheit und hätte so nicht rauskommen sollen immer wieder laden Texturen nach und Gegenstände ploppen auf die Texturen sind matschig und nicht zeitgemäß Das Wasser sieht sehr billigen aus und die Lavatextur kann man nicht als Lava bezeichnen die Dörfer sind sehr klein und bestehen aus Copy Paste Häusern Bei Treppen hat man sich nicht die Mühe gemacht diees sauber Einzufügen Sondern hat unsichtbar schrägen drunter legen in Höhlen hat man überall Weiße pixelig Umrisse die aussehen als hätt jemand gerade erst Photoshop geöffnet die Story ist wie in jid Pokemon nicht der Rede wert und auch das Postgame ist nichts besonderes ABERPro Die Welt ist relativ offen man kann al Pokemon auf de Overworld seh und hat keine Random Pokemon im Hohen Gras die Shiny Pokemon sind sichtbar gemacht worden und es ist seit langen ein Pokemon in dem man al pokemon Fangen kann Das System den Pokedex zu füllen und durch Missionen aufzuwerten sorgen trotzdem dafür das man weiterhin vieel pokemon fang will es gibt keine Routen auf denen man mit Trainerkämpfen zugespammt wird und es gibt keine langen auf und ab animation vor jead Kampf die das Spiel unnötig strecken alles in al ist es ein Pokemonspiel wie ich es mir wünsche da es mir nicht vorkommen als wrün ich Stunden damit verbringen die animation zu seh Aber es ist leider grafisch nur eine Alpha Version Wenn man Das Ausblenden kann dann hat man aber definitiv Spaß mit dem Spiel 
okay pokemon offer a slightly different gameplay Which in itself might appeal to one or the other However the game zijn overrated in my opinion Technically it ' not just a dress Coat it Also looks ugly Any 20 year old GameCube gaam looks better Indi games on Steam without à lot of budget have a much better technique There zijn not just one billion dollar company behind the gaam her but two So I can ' rate it well For 60 euros I expect quality in every respect Okay Pokemon bietet ein etwas anderes Gameplay an zijn an sich vllt dem Einem oderen ander auch gefallen mogen Allerdings Wird das Spiel meiner Meinung Nach vallen zu hoch angepriesen es ist technisch nicht nur ein Frack sondern sioeht dazu auch noch hässlich aus Jedes 20 jahres alte GameCube Spiel sieht besser aus Indi Spiele auf steam ohne vallen budget haben eine vallen besser technik hier steckt nicht nur ein Millardenschweres Unternhmen hinter dem Spiel Sondern gleich zwei Daher kann ich es nicht gut bewerten Für 60 euro erwarte ich Qualität in jederlei hinsicht 
Also sry ja pokemon macht mal zijn Neues aber dennoch ist Das Spiel nicht fertig Ich erwart von einer Millionen Franchise Marke wie Pokemon Mehr als nur eine Mehr schlecht als recht Kopie von Monster Hunter Rise Elementen Das Spiel hat eine Unterirdische Grafik und selbst für die Leistungsschwach Switch ist Das nicht ok siehe MH BotW Xenoblade chronicle etc Ich verstehe auch nicht wie de Gameplayloop Spass macht denn es besteht eigentlich nur aus Rollen und Ball werfen + manchmal etwas Kämpfen auf nem Sehr einfachen Schwierigkeitsgrad Dieses Pokemon hat Einfach alles Wegrazionalisiert zijn Pokemon ausmacht es gibt kein PVP nur eine Handvoll trainer kämpfen keine Ligen oder wirklichen Challenges keinen richtigen Plot haten Pokemon nie aber man hier ist die Story echt flach usw Die Gelbcolorierten Boss pokemon muss man auch nicht bekämpfen es reicht zu Rollen und dem Vieh ein Säckchen an die Birne zu werfen dabei wirkt es nicht sehr fordernd Das Spiel bietet eigentlich nichts ausser Grind da du mal dieses Pokemon fangen musst Beeren ben sollslen und mal dieses Pokemon Person A zeig sollsen die hohen wertungen kann ich nur verstehen Wenn sie von Casual Spielern kommen welch leider ausser den Mobilegames keine wirklich gaming Erfahrung besitzen Ich sage nicht das Spiel kann einem nicht Spass machen aber für mich Jedenfalls ist dieser ewig grind und die Wiederholenden Aufgaben mit de minimalistischen Grafik und der etwa 20h beschäftigungs Foltertherapie nichts Positiv zijn neue probiertNegativ Freche MH Rise Kopie von Mechaniken Map mit Biomen Quest dorf crafting etc in vallen schlechter Unterirdische Grafik wiederholender langweiliger Loop und Grind keine Voice Ausgabe in 2022 Das wäre doch mal ein Fortschritt Nur etwas mehr als 200 Pokemon Keine guten Funktionen aus älteren Teilen übernommen Mega Entwicklung Schwierigkeitsgrad pvp etc Reduktion de Attackenmovesets auf ein Mimimum Kein Multiplayer Framerate einbrüch aus de Höhle Wird sich verkaufen wie heisse Schokolade weil hlen Pokemon drauf stehtFazit Hiesse dieses Spiel nicht Pokemon dann wrün es wohl als schlechter monster Hunter Rise Wannabe Klon abgestempelen worden Nostalgie ist echt ein Grausamer „ ich aktzeptier alles Faktor 
frechheit so zijn rau zu bringen Schlecht grafik langweilig quest Durch und durch schlecht 
gamefreak gibt sich Null Mühe denn sie wissen das sich jeder Pokémon Fan dieses Game kaufen wird egal wie Sch*isse es aussieht Und sowas unterstütze ich nicht Arceus sieht aus als hätt es ein 3 Jähriger entwickellen 
Schwaches Spiel Meiner Meinung Nach GrafikGameplayModelle in DörfernUnabwechslungsreich modelle 
excellent gamar Great start for a seria i hope continu to evolve and pudir out multiple sequel 
                                          
"전체적으로 재미있으나 역시나 게임 프리크이다 . 스토리는 외전작인 포켓몬스터 불가사의 던전 에서 벤치마킹이 많이 된것같음 , 그래도 자연스럽고 재미있는 스토리 . 포획 , 도감 시스템은 이벤트의 템포가 빨라져 긍정적인 변화 였다고 판단이라고 생각 . 전투 시스템은 익숙하진 않지만 재미있고 , 이전에 타 스탯에 비해 크게 신경쓰지 않았던 스피드와 PP 에 무게감이 있어 마음에 들었음 . 성장 시스템에서 라이트유저와 해비 유저도 전체적으로 만족할만한 시스템이라고 생각함 . 모험 시스템은 타 오픈월드 게임에 비해서는 부족하다는 느낌과 이전 게임과 비교해서 큰차이를 느끼지 못했음 . 이외의 부정적인 의견은 온라인 배틀이 없음 , NPC 의 생동감히 전혀 없음 , 난이도가 전체적으로 너무 쉬움 , 다중배틀이 없어져서 너무 아쉬움 , 포켓몬스터 레츠고 처럼 외전느낌이 있음 . 전체적으로 마음에 드나 기대 이하인것은 확실하고 이후의 오픈월드 게임에 더 기대가 감 . "
el juego más infravalorado de el saga posiblemente el mejor de todo Nintendo GF él haber volver a hacer año después BRAVO 
Pokemon Leyendas Arceus ser uno juegazo gráficamente ser normal pero él que ser en el resto de apartado simplemente él hacer ser uno de el mejor juego tú atrapir de uno manera descontrolado no ser repetitivo como alguno creer el historia ser buen si querer historia mejor cómprense pelijuego o directamente ir al cine el cambio en el jugabilidad el sistema de combate él hacer más dinámico fluido que tú atacar el pkmns él dar uno toque de dificultad nuevo que haber contener recortado él entender porque ser uno época pasado él de el distorsión simplemente ser uno añadido mucho divertido pelear capturar con pkmns alfa ser otro inclusión mucho buen Solo cómprenlo diviértanse 
como fan de Pokémon desde el 98 este ser uno gran paso para el saga no poder esperar a el siguiente entrega 
el camino a seguir para Game Freak no ser el juego perfecto pero tampoco ser uno cero como haber ver por ahí así que estar nota ser para nivelar ese hate que parecer que existir hacia este saga mi nota real ser uno 8 10 gráficamente ser flojo ese ser indudable pero tener mucho bondad que deber persistir en el saga si o si 
este ser uno mucho buen juego ser divertido tener uno capacidad de envolver al jugador que yo traer a mi infancia aunque poder mejorar su gráfico todo ese él compensar con el jugabilidad que generar uno experiencia maravilloso ser el Pókemon que siempre haber querer ojalá el siguiente juego de el IP ser tener este como base de jugabilidad 
el juego ser increíble ser hasta ahora el primero juego de Pokémon que trascender el fórmula tradicional estar enfocado en el exploración por él que como ser de esperar él el dificultad ser bastante alto en especial con el tema de el Pokémon Alfa tener todo él que él faltar a el saga 
Nah boludo este juego estar re piolir boludo Che este juego estar buenardo papu 
el juego yo encantar Pensaba que ir a ser uno aburrimiento solo capturar pokemon pero sentir el emoción el nervio para atrapar al que querer huir de el pokemon alfa yo encantar el ambiente el mundo el personaje el crafteo el nuevo pokedex el sistema de captura el aspecto gráfico ser mejorable si llegar a estar a el altura del ZBOTW ser uno juegazo nunca visto pese a todo este el juego ser adictivo tú enganchar desde el primero momento no saber como hacer el siguiente juego pero esperar que tener en cuenta todo él que haber meter en el Arceus no dar uno paso atrás 
mucho buen juego jugadlo despues hablai Este pokemon él merecer cualquiera elogio que él él dedicar 
yo encantar no haber jugar Pokémon desde Gold Silver él poco que llevar del juego él estar disfrutar bastante 
mejor dinámicas ser uno buen evolución para el franquicia ojalá mejorar el gráfico mantener el nuevo dinámica 
el gráfico estar mal pero no ese no quitar que ser uno buen juego Tras pasármelo ya en el postgame actualmente yo haber encantar Destaco el nuevo mecánica de captura que ser bastante adictivo entretenido él vivo que estar el Pokémon Atacandote proteger él en manada cada ves que ir a por uno poke otro cosa que destaco ser el dificultad del juego yo llevar uno sorpresa Llegue al final del juego con 10 nivel el juego yo haber encantar él recomeir sin duda 
este juego ser absolutamente renovador tener alguno detalle a mi parecer en cuanto a el dinámica por ejemplo para mover él entre zona no tú dar opción de ir libremente sino que hab él con el personaje de salida él indicar el zona en automático llega Como ser uno juego que tú incitar a el exploración él contradizar uno poco en ese sentido Por él demá estar mucho contento ser el juego que estar esperar desde que tener 10 año comprar el pokémon yellow para game boy color ser uno brutalidad pero aún él poder mejorar si él hacer él comprar sin pensármelo 2 vez mucho recomendado 
Independiente de el critica que haber leer por tema de grafico o de mucho texto Si ese él molestar ser porque este tipo de juegos no ser para tú así de simple no servir para juegos tipo RPG donde haber que leer para mi el juego cumplir con su función totalmente ser entretener uno nuevo mundo en él que ser Pokémon cumplir totalmente mi expectativa esperar seriamente que gf seguir por este camino yo de este tipo de experiencia a futuro 
el cambio que necesitar este saga realmente no disfrutar tanto de uno juego de Pokemon desde por él menos 10 11 año 
ser posiblemente el mejor juego de pokemon ser uno gran paso en el dirección correcto por parte de game freak Recomendadisimo 
buen juego el apartado grafico ser él unico que dejar algo que desear pero todo él dema ser bueno no dar mala critica solo por 1 cosa malo 
hacer año que no disfrutar así de uno juego de pokemon tener duda con el gráfico pero ser el primero vez que capturar pokemon ser emocionante Cabe destacar el historia que hablar más del mundo pokemon su mitología yo él estar pasar como nunca 
haber mejorar bastante ser uno cambio que necesitar pokemon aunque su calidad grafico no ser excelente él compensar con todo él dema mucho buen juego Algo raro al principio pero ser logico despues de tanto año jugar a uno juego de pokemon ahora cambiar a este Pero tú acostumbrar rápido 
aunque en general todo esperábar uno gran salto técnico despues del primero teaser dentro de él que siempre haber resultar Pokemon haber mejorar sustancialmente ese sí el popping el textura ser mejorable pero el diente de sierra avez poder sacar de el inmersiónLa historio yo parecer fresco el personaje aceptable no obstante Sol Luna BW o incluso el viejo Diamond Pearl tener mayor cantidad de personaje entrañabl Si bien el mundo abierto ser algo reciente en Pokemon el implementación de todo en conjunto quedar como base para uno 9na gen con competitivo todo el cosaslo único ser que en pos de uno aventura single player el criba de movimiento ser aun mas grande él cual él hacer para instaurar el sistema de combate que suponer solo él quedar en este entrega 
Pokémon Legends Arceus marcar uno nuevo inicio de el franquicia el jugador que amar Pokémon estarer agradecido por este evolución que mezclar el dinámica de el juego como Let ’ Go con exploración uno mundo semi abierto el zona ser él suficientemente grande con el cantidad necesario de Pokémon salvaje que no truncar el movilidad estar emocionado por ver uno próximo juego con el primero liga combate contra entrenador él agradecer el aumento de dificultad ya no ser suficiente tener Pokémon 20 nivel arriba del Pokémon al que yo enfrentar el apartado técnico mejorar con el próximo entrega el Fe hacia GameFreak haber regresar ojalá haber aprender de el error del pasado esperar con ansia el traducción a Español Latino ya ser hora ✌ 
Voten 10 para que mi hermano yo él compre tener que llegar como mínimo a 8 de gente gracias por su comprensión 
todo él que nintendo hacer ser obra maestraperfecto pokemon leyenda arceus no ser el excepción 
uno 10 literalmente ser él que llevar esperar desde que tener 5 año el jugabilidad él acercar mucho más a el del ánime que el juego de el saga principal ser él que yo yo imaginar que ser uno juego de Pokémon antes de tener uno uno videojuego donde poder estar con tu Pokémon fuera de el pokeball todo él donde el combate ser tanto dinámico como aquí pudiera moverte mientras este transcurrir poder atrapar Pokémon lanzándol uno pokeball mientras estar hacer cualquiera otro cosa distraído hacer tiempo que uno juego de Pokémon yo enganchar tanto ser uno grandísimo paso para el saga que esperar que seguir por este camino ver que así ser gracias a el próximo generación que prometer mucho después de terminar este videojuego ya tener uno gana terrible de jugar ese nuevo Pokemon mundo abierto basado en mi España que tanto prometer que gana de Pokémon Escarlata Pokémon Púrpura o como yo gustar llamarl Pokemon Uva Naranja o Vino Naranjito jajar Para yo en este año 2022 Game Freak él haber hacer de fábula esperar que seguir así mi más sincero enhorabuena tú habéis superado 
ser cierto que no tener buen gráfico pero cuando ser pequeño ese no importo con el game boy por que ser divertir ahora por fin después de mucho año regresar con ese alegría de niño de nueve tildar yo de infantil o él que ser pero yo estar disfrutar reto a que el que yo contradecir que al menos tener uno nivel de doctorado para hablar de colega a colega no uno niño que solo pasar ver el pc 
este juego ser simplemente todo él que deseabar de Pokemon desde hacer mucho tiempo ser verdad que su gráfico no ser él último pero este él dejar a uno lado ya que el inmersión en Hissui ser total haber mucho por hacer ver este hacer que Legends Arceus ser uno juego rico para mi uno 10 
yo fascinar el juego en ninguno momento dudar de su compra el experiencia mucho inmersivo 
de aquí deber partir el franquicia para el siguiente entrega comentar él de el grafico este de más si gusta de disfrutar uno juego adelante 
ser verdad que graficamente no ser sorprendente pero el gugabilidad ser todo él que necesitar necesitar desde que jugar pokemon RED realmente ser mucho rapido cazar pokemon o entrar a batalla ser mucho fluido 
Jugue pokemon espada poder decir con certeza que pokemon legends arceu ser algo completamente distinto cumplir mucho de el sueño de el fan ser sin duda el mejor juego de pokemon que el fan haber estar esperar 
uno juego mucho disfrutable a pesar de tener alguno fallo a nivel técnico de él mejor de pokemon en el último año 
mucho mas divertido mejor hecho entretenido que el ultimo Shin Megami Tensei de el mismo consola Como haber decir antes mucho vez el estado actual de Pokémon ser mas que envidiable ya que en vez de continuar con el formula ganador que siempre haber resultar adictivo él haber arriesgar en hacer algo nuevo él haber salir de perla 
el tutorial yo parecer estándar dentro de el franquicia accesible explicar todo bien no ser necesariamente malo que durar alguno hora porque en uno RPG tanto complejo de masterizar como ser Pokémon ser necesario aclarar todo antes de dejarte rienda suelto al jugador Explorar el mundo ser uno deleite tanto por el color el hermoso vegetación el cantidad apabullante de pokémon que interactuar existen dentro del entorno tal cual como él hacer uno animal en el vida real el sistema de combate haber ser simplificar pero de manera concienzudo para ser mas difícil respecto al reto de pokémon mas salvaj algo que en todo el saga haber ser demasiado fácil el progresión el misión todo tú hacer experimentar cosa nuevo el personaje estar hecho con mucho mimo yo recomendar no quedar él solo con el gráfico este juego ser mucho mas que ese el que de verdad apreciar Pokémon comprender su tradición gozarar como uno crío el opinion mas correcto ser celebrar este titulo como algo grande 
Excelso divino mucho adictivo así describo el forma en el que ser el aventura de Leyendas Arceus respecto a Let ' Go que ser sin duda para mi el juego mas flojo de el saga principal PLA seguir el camino de Espada Escudo en ser otro gran representante de Pokémon en uno consola de alto definición 
Pokemon ir por buen camino en su renovación Gráficos aparte ser uno gran juego En jugabilidad sobretodo en dinamismo él hacer mucho dinamico el capturar entrar en combate que ser él que mas pesado él yo hacer de el anterior entrega 
gran juego el gente que él quejar tanto ser pq desde hacer siglo él dejar de gustar el saga 
el verdad ser que este Pokémon a diferencia de mucho otro conseguir cambiar el esquemática de Pokémon hacer que el mecánica el historia de fondo ser mucho mas disfrutabl Sin duda uno increíble mejora desde el juego pasado 
el mejor juego de pokemon que haber jugar mucho entretenido e historia espectacular 
jajajajajajajaj take this haters bueno no e comprar el juego pero de verdad querer jugar uno pokemon con buen nota asi que harar este 
este mucho bueno ser el dirección correcto que deber seguir el franquicia Ojalá para el próximo juego poder arreglar el carencia gráfico pero mantener todo el mecánica de este titulo profundisarla 
independientemente de el grafico que ser algo feo el juego ser uno joyita ser atrapante mucho divertido buena mecanica buen gameplay buen duración uno historia bastante buen para mi ser 10 10 
ser justo él que necesitar el franquicia esperar que este base consolidir el futuro de Pokémon porque ser el dirección correcto 
ser él que llevar pedir des de hacer tiempo el gráfico ser duro de ver pero ser él que el saga necesitar des de hacer siglo este ser el camino que deber seguir de ahora en adelante Por fin él hacer incapié de verdad en el lore el nota estar gigainflado pero yo que él 
yo encantar el juego él que graficamente ser limitado pero tener zona realmente bonitasrevolucionario su mecanicad top 
mucho disfrutable como fan de el saga desde el primero entrega recomeir encarecidamente este titulo el gráfico no ser destacable pero no rompar el tónica positivo del mismo 
simplemente el obra magno de el saga tú olvir de el bajo calidad gráfico en cuanto empieza a jugar va descubrir uno mundo que rebosar misterio aventurar si ser fan de Pokémon no poder perderte este juego bajo ninguno concepto 
ser uno juego que cambiar completamente el mecánica que haber tener el saga de Pokémon durante década ser uno título fresco entretenido lleno de lugar para explorar tomar él el tiempo de ver el detalle a cada zona el único detalle notable ser el apartado gráfico el cual aunque no ser mucho bueno lograr uno optimización mucho buen tener 30 cuadro por segundo estable este juego ser él que necesitar el saga 
el mejor juego de el puta historia si no yo crees voy yo cojo a tu puta madre 
uno oda de nostalgia a Sinnoh Pokémon Diamante Perla ser de mi región favorito este reinterpretación de el base general de el serie él hacer completo honor justicia realmente sientes el presión en el ambiente cada vez que explorar uno nuevo lugar tú encontrar con pokémon alfa uno sensación que poco juego dentro de el franquicia yo haber hacer sentir 
Ludonarrativamente Sonante gracias a Engels a Marx por darno educación político para poder entender este obra 
comenzar uno nuevo era en el mundo de el Pokémon Dejando atrás el lineal encajonado mundo yo adentrar por fin en uno extenso mundo rico de detalle lleno de pokémons en cada esquina 
haber jugar juego de mierda todo mi vida pero este juego ser Jesucristo amar el gráfico el nuevo aditamento el inicio ser uno poco flojo tutorial pero después todo ser uno vicio 
Nintendo haber hacer uno juego glorioso el gente deber tener uno poco menos de ce él en especial de cierto comunidad que no en necesario nombrar Este Pokémon ser él que él saga siempre haber necesitar el Breath of the Wild de Pokémon si así poder decir él el que mucho tanto ansiar Como para que alguno caradura de el vida él atreir a despotricar por detalle sin interéspokémon empezar por allá en el primero Game Boy como uno juego de capacidad humilde a así siempre haber soler ser no tener sentido que de uno día para otro solo importir el gráfico ignorar todo él demá que hacer al juego grande Espero que disfrutéis mucho de el videojuego de este en particular Jajajaja 
Gente no deis por saco con el gráfico que no ser tanto malo En verdad ser uno juegazo 
Pokémon hacer algo de él cual cuando estár niño soñar él hacer posible Dejemos del lado el gráfico en 4k o no simplemente el juego tú envolver a tal grado que tú divertir como cuando estár niño Pokémon de ese él tratar de divertir él de pasar el rato agusto De hacer amigo sobre todo de atrapar él a todostodo gracias Pokémon por este juego 
realmente el cambio que necesitar Pokémon con problema técnico gráfico evidente pero sin descuidar el jugabilidad el emersión que de el título estar de verdad mucho enviciado a este juegazo esperar que en uno futuro el saga aprenda de el error acierto de Legendas Arceus 
ser el forma más fresco de aventura que haber vivir en uno juego de Pokémon no solo el Pokémon evolucionar también él hacer el personaje tu entorno tú sentir realmente parte de ese mundo su concepto primitivo tú hacer redescubrir concepto básico de el saga recrear leyenda que haber en el saga tal vez no ser todo él bonito visualmente que quisiérir pero ser uno gran paso en el dirección correcto él disfrutar más en el modo portátil solo desear que llegar uno DLC para tener más Pokémon que investigar 242 él hacer poco necesitar el subsuelo para atrapar mucho mucho más 
jugar mucho top En mi opinión el mejor de el saga Pokemon él tener todo él ver que el compañía ir en mucho buen dirección con este tipo de juegos estar desear que salir Kanto Johto Hoenn 
mucho buen juego yo encantar poder ver a el pokemon caminar por ahí yo encantar 
uno juego salido de él convencional a uno jugabilidad refrescante encuentro nuevo 
simplemente ser impresionante más de 45 hora de juego tener actualmente aún no terminar todo el misión secundario ser verdad que gráficamente él faltar razón por el cual no él dar el 10 pero mi problema principal ser el historia yo él que PKM no él distinguir por el historia pero al ser uno juego llamado leyenda Arceus esperar más pues él deber mejor llamar leyenda Sinho o leyendas diamante per él pues ser casi nulo el presencia de Arceus tanto en historia principal como post game fuera de ese ser uno juegazo 
este entrega de el franquicia ser todo uno declaración de intención Game Freak haber unir concepto de todo el spin off de el rama principal junto a uno lore e historia entrelazado que lograr uno historia mucho vivo su banda sonoro seguir a el altura destacar muchísimo sobre todo el remezcla de viejo melodía tema de combate su sistema de batalla ser uno acierto sin perder el esencia de él que siempre haber ser pero con suficiente argumento como para cimentar uno cambio evidente Este ser el camino a seguir uno proyecto que no tener por qué darno ya que el viejo fórmula seguir funcionar en cuanto a repercusión mediático en el grande masa que sin embargo haber tener el valor de traspasar uno barrera complicado no tener el 10 por mi parte ya que su apartado técnico no artístico ya que este ser bueno orgánico seguir ser insuficiente ser el mejor entrega desde el ya pasado 7º generación 
el juego ser mucho bueno este mucho bien el sistema Si tener problema técnico bugs etc pero cumplir en su apartado de mecánica Contento por el juego creer que haber mucho gente que él molestar que este bien él aferrar a el gráfico malo el bugs etc pero creer que haber mucho juego así después con uno parche él solucionar como soler hacer el resto de juego parecer ser que hoy en día tener que ser o blanco o negro no poder haber uno bonito escala de grís si haber algo mal ya este mal todo creer que el juego estar para disfrutar desconectar relajarte pasar él bien creer que nadie en ninguno momento hacer algo perfecto siempre tener alguno defecto ser humano haber ser año difícil por el situación actual Creo yo yo incluyo que haber mucho gente que decir menudo mierdo no yo llamar Pero al final el hype tirar él compra descubrir uno juego que en dos hueco que haber tener para jugar él yo enganche creer que mucho gente él haber llevar uno sorpresa grata 
PLA ser el juego que el franquicia necesitar hacer más de uno década ser uno experiencia totalmente diferente que no dejar de sorprender yo a cada momento el apartado gráfico sufrir pero no él suficiente como para dañar el nuevo forma de vivir Pokémon uno excelente primero paso para el futuro de el monstruo de bolsillo 
ser el mejor juego de Pokémon de el último décado el cambio de formato él sentir como uno aire fresco renovador para el saga el habitual jpg basado en gimnasio liga llegar a su culmen en Pokémon blanco negro su secuela el entrega posterior solo ser a peor culminar en el desastre de Pokémon espado escudo en el remaster porque no remakar de sinnoh Para el futuro arreglar el apartado gráfico porque él restar mucho él posicionar a el ojo del público comprensiblemente en uno posición mucho inferior a el que merecer con respecto a el título lanzado en 2022 incluso con ese apartado gráfico Leyendas Pokémon Arceus ser fácilmente uno de el mejor Pokémon de el historia el mejor Pokémon en Nintendo Switch eclipsar dejar en evidencia a el último tres generación de Pokémon todo el spin off que él haber acompañar uno digno GOTY 10 si tener uno apartado gráfico a el altura de este saga Sin embargo juego indispensable de game freak que por fin él atrevir a salir de su zona de confort de uno forma bastante acertado Pokémon haber volver si seguir por este camino poder volver con mucho fuerza 
técnicamente el juego ser uno patato inaceptable en pleno 2022 recibir uno juego así pero él notar el esfuerzo el paso adelante que haber dar el saga Con el buena mecánica que haber meter el dos nuevo estilo de combate el captura lanzar el Pokéballs en tiempo real poder moverte en medio de el combate pero con uno apartado técnico más cuidado con diferente poblado ciudad ruta gimnasio poder quedar él uno noveno generación mucho bonito con mucho potencial 
Soplo de aire fresco para este saga menudo sorpresa a nivel jugable ser él que todo fan de Pokemon desear jugar el gráfico ser mediocre por ese no él poder dar uno diez Pero en él que respectar a agilidad mecánica jugabl de atrapar pokemon combatir yo parecer el dirección correcto en el saga De hecho si el siguiente generación no incluir este jugabilidad yo parecer uno gran error que retroceder el saga Espero que el mundo abierto el exploración el captura el combate sin transición ágil vengar para quedar él para siempre el estilo de combate preferir el original en el saga original en este saga Leyendas estar bien ese de estilo rápido estilo fuerte el banda sonoro también cumplir sobradamente el historia poder ser algo más maduro aunque yo parecer el camino correcto muchísimo mejor que el historia de Espada Escudo Animo a todo fan no fan a probar él En resumen por favor Game Freak seguir así 
el soundtrack ser de él mejor del Juego uno nuevo fórmula refrescante de verdad ser él que franquiciar necesitar esperar que para el 9va generación seguir con este fórmula 
el mejor juego de el franquicia ser cierto aún tener mucho cosa por pulir mayormente derivado del poco tiempo de desarrollo que permitir Pokémon company sin embargo ser el camino por el que deber de seguir 
de el crítica mala que haber leer solo deber decir que el único que tomo en cuenta ser el grafica yo encontrar frente al primero cambio en el mecánica de juego de uno pokemon ese si no excento de fallo sin embargo para ser el primero gran incursión de el compañía fuera del típico juego simplón sin alma que llevar hacer desde el nintendo 3ds él él perdonar innovar con nuevo forma de juego tramo sencillo pero mas disfrutable algo de dificultad uno poco mas elevado En fin uno juego bastante entretenido distinto que invitar a explorar su mundo como él ser el juego de pokemon en uno principio 
tener que jugar él sentir él para ver él rápido del combate él divertido adictivo en portátil él disfrutar como en el época de Game Boy el estilo anime kodomo ser perfecto no contar con textura pulida salvo elemento de juego tener cierto poping aunque en elemento donde no ir tu vista jugable el distancia de dibujado no ser malo aunque el textura no estar en alta a poco uno parche él él poder subir uno poco per no él hacer falta al ser anime kodomo no deber tener mucho definición el transfondo ni detalle ser uno juego de Pokémon el juego tú llevar perfecto el banda sonoro el sonido ambiente ser el mejor de el serie perfectamente dirigido el ciclo día noche ser perfecto el Pokémon lucir como nunca Sin duda obligatorio nunca 
no ser uno sorpresa mencionar que el gráfico realmente ser malo el solo hecho de que haber zona que él sentir grande pero tapizado por textura sencillo que dar uno imagen pobre a el calidad grafico del juego también como defecto poder llegar a tener trama en el historia que simplemente no tener sentido pero ser Pokémon él entender aparte de que ser poco ser mas uno cuestión personal pero dejar ese dos cosa de lado como fan de Monster Hunter Pokémon que realmente no él importar el gráfico el juego ser realmente bueno divertido con mecánica adictiva clásico de cualquiera juego de mundo semi abierto como crafteo el recolección aparte que haber varios zona escondido mucho misión secundario para pasarte uno buen rato 
yo parecer que este juego ser el rumbo que tener que llevar el saga que tener su fallo Si Bastantes Que él ver mal también ser horrible Pero sin duda ser el mejor juego de pokémon desde blanco negro hacer mucho cosa bien 
en él personal creer que ser uno excelente propuesta para el saga Pokemon él aplaudir intentar hacer algo nuevo él poder mejorar Pues claro como todo pero ser uno buen inicio si tú gustar Pokemon en mi opinión valer el pena 
Juegazo si ser fan de Pokémon o incluso si no él ser peca de ser gráficamente inferior o técnicamente deficiente sin embargo ser uno trago de aire fresco a el franquicia Sin perder el base clásico de pokemon 
él fallar el gráfico mucho pero todo él demá ser uno maravilla esperar que el saga seguir este rumbo si tú gustar el rpg pokemon haber de jugar él actualmente él haber volver mi juego de pokemon favorito 
tras terminar él pasar uno tiempo de reflexión llego a el conclusión de que estar ante el mejor juego de Pokémon de el década pese a poder encontrar carencia este título yo sorprender con nuevo mecánica con el que Game Freak haber querer romper el fórmula actual de Pokémon el juego perder de cierto forma su linealidad hacer que ser bastante adictivo Con uno historia que hacer que el personaje ganar bastante personalidad respecto a otro entrega 
Juegazo todo este año buscar juego 3rd party con más mecánica que el original parecer que GameFreak escuchar Tiene todo él que espera de uno juego de Pokémon más no él dar el 10 porque sentir que él faltar batalla con entrenador sí haber pero faltar más uno selector de dificultad para el veterano de el saga 
ser algo repetitivo tener uno inicio mucho lento uno gráfico mejorable pese a él conseguir enganchartir de principio a fin tanto su Gameplay revolucionario para el franquicia como el desarrollo de el historia sanzonado con uno sensación de tener que atrapar él a todo hacer que este videojuego ser uno de el grande título de este año por endir uno experiencia mucho recomendado 
ser el toque de inovación que él hacer falta a el franquicia en su propio evolución gráficamente poder no ser uno excelencia pero su arte concepto detalle sumado a su dinámica fresca de jugabilidad hacer que no quierar dejar de jugar él al sentirte inmerso él que cómo fan esperábar ver alguno día él estar ver realizado 
mucho por encima de mi expectativa divertido dinámico uno forma mucho refrescante de jugar Pokémon 
ser alguien que abandono el franquicia en el 5ta generación uno de el mejor de todas decir que poder volver a disfrutar uno pokemon no ser poco cosa para mi Este ser el camino que tal vez pokemon tener que haber seguir hacer tiempo uno mundo abierto donde realmente pod sentirte en conexión con el pokemon e interactuar mas directamente con él mas allá de solo el combate con uno mecánica mucho simple pero bien implementada que ir de maravilla con él que ser el franquicia aun ser uno spin off no de el saga principal tener falla obviamente el motor grafico ser uno insulto para el estándar actual a él que el comprobado con juego como Zelda BOTW o Luigi Mansion 3 consola poder ofrecer él que él haber volver mucho mas envolvente en él visual en el experiencia pero que tampoco interrumpir el fluidez del juego el historia ser otro punto que flaqueir mas que todo hacia el final terminar de manera uno poco abruptar sin dar él casi nada de relevancia al pokemon con el nombre en el juego enfocándosir mas al postgame aunque sin dejar de ser él suficientemente interesante como para seguir querer avanzar uno titulo que fallar bastante pero que tener muchísimo para mejorar ofrecer si él él trabajar como él deber el cual Company poder explotar sin que afectar a el saga principal ser Arceus uno spin off que poder derivar en mucho entrega mas de este tipo volviéndolo uno saga yo esperar que él ser él dar uno punto de confianza para que él seguir por este camino cambio que el franquicia necesitar 
el gráfico ser uno poco malo pero el jugabilidad yo haber parecer genial uno buen juego 
el juego en si ser mucho bueno en mecanica en diferente aspecto poder durar hora hora jugandolo ni tú dar cuenta ser mucho entretenido el unico problema ser su apartado grafico que parecer videojuego del gamecube 
yo no jugar por el gráfico el video juegos ser para entretener el que solo criticar el gráfico nunca entender el video juegos Pokémon Legends Arceus ser uno juego muuy entretenido si tener carencia en el aspecto gráfico más tratar él de uno conglomerado como the pokemon company e inclusive hasta narrativo pero haber que recordar que no ser el fuerte de pokemon Pero a cambio yo dar uno juego super divertido donde tú pasar hora capturar pokemons sentir reviveir sensación e ilusión de cuando erar uno pibe niño pequeño si pokémon legenda arceu él alimentar de nostalgia porque tener el TM Pokemon su mundo por detrás Dejen de tirar odio disfrutir el video juegos ser para todo 
partir decir que el juego él haber encontrar espectacular uno cambio radical en el saga el mecánica de juego estar bien logrado ser el primero vez que uno realmente él sentir inmerso en el mundo pokemon Si creer que haber cierto cosa que mejorar como uno historia principal más largo más robusta mayor cantidad de pokemons disponible Para ser uno primero entrega en este formato tanto distinto a él anterior realizado por Gamefreak él entender el falta grafica para uno segundo entrega el fan ser menos complacient 
mejor juego de el historia de el franquicia sin embargo con mucho margen de mejora para el proximo entrega si ser fan de pokemon 100 recomendable 
quedar mucho camino por andar Pero haber esperanza si seguir por este sendero ser uno gran soplo de aire de fresco a el franquicia que mas factura del mundo Empezamos a vislumbrar el Pokemon que todo querer con el que soñábamos cuándo elegir a nuestro primero starter en aquel ladrillo llamado game boy en pueblo Paleta Para yo el nuevo mecánica del juego el historia junto con el banda sonoro ser él mejor Pero pedir más sobre todo en él primero Historia bien narrado e interesante con alguno sorpresa que no espera personaje bien construído ahora bien haber cosa que mejorar 1 Tutorial Excesivamente largo deber ser opcional Si ya jugaste que no tú contar el vida entero Que no tener 10 año todo el que jugar 2 Doblaje GAME freak doblar el juego de uno vez que por dinero no ser 3 Gráficos mucho internet explorer ps3 el switch dar para mucho más 4 Entorno Aumentar el cantidad de Pokémon poder ver a el Pokemon hacer más cosa comer pelear entre él manada de ponyta correr libremente Al igual que el npc del pueblo que él relacionir él mueir que el vea llendo a casa más realidad 
Evidentemente estar ante el mejor juego de Pokemon que él haber desarrollar nunca ser súper entretenido a nivel gráfico haber parte que él prestar a foto Comprendo que haber gente que esperar más del apartado técnico saber que el consola poder este Pokemon estar lejos de alcanzar el potencial que poder hacer dicho este no ir a valorar el gráfico Sencillamente ser el pokemon con mejor gráfico Loq ue si ir a valorar ser el repetitivismo de el saga no poder ser a este altura que todo cada uno de el Pokemon hacer exactamente él mismo sin apenas ninguno variación saber que él tratar de cazar Pokemon pero coñir que el 95 del juego él hacer ese uno otro vez que para colmo al llegar al final del juego el boss o boss final tú obligar a subir otro 20 nivel de golpe para poder vencer al juego ser totalmente ridículo frustrante por cierto él dar uno 8 porque no estar valorar el gráfico el próximo entrega si él hacer porque ya haber haber uno precedente 
este ser el primero juego de Pokémon que comprar desde el a mi ver decepcionante remak de Pokémon zafiro rubí para 3DS yo parecer uno cambio de concepto interesante cuando él anunciar decidir comprar él ya que además él poder conseguir fácilmente por cosa de 40 euros De buena a primeras pensar que el juego seguramente él yo hacer mucho repetitivo rápidamente con él de capturar Pokémon pero yo equivocar en este aspecto el mecánica jugabl de este juego ser mucho buena a mi ver haber pasar uno buen rato jugar este juego En cuanto a el misión pensar que ser más repetitiva pero al final todo tener su toque En cuanto al tema gráfico efectivamente este ser el apartado que más lastro el juego él notar alguno logo borroso en el ropa de el personaje el forma en el que él ver el movimiento de el Pokémon de tipo volador en el distancia dejar uno poco sin palabra por su falta de pulimento De todo forma en general el juego él ver decente ser a el larga distancia donde él notar principalmente este falta de pulimento gráfico De todo forma este aspecto a mi ver este ya depender de cada persona no afectar a el experiencia de juego Para ser uno juego de mundo abierto aunque este sub dividido en varios zona ser prácticamente de mundo abierto el juego tener mucho poco Bugs algo mucho difícil de lograr en este tipo de juego ser el único bug que yo haber encontrar uno Gyarados volador Que según yo decir alguno no ser uno bug el juego también tener cierto detalle que yo gustar como que el personaje él ir manchar con el barro o mojar cuando llover o que el asentamiento principal del juego ir crecer cambiar por tu acción según vas avanzar A mi ver este juego ser mucho divertido él merecer uno 8 ser estar nota así por su falta de pulimento gráfico 
uno evolucion en el formula de el franquicia divertido adictivo punto mejorable ser el grafico aspirano uno nivel como él visto en monter haunter rise 
el juego de Pokémon mas inmersivo que jamás haber existir el juego sinceramente cumplir mucho bien ya él necesitar algo nuevo dentro de el saga este mismo él terminar hacer de uno manera excelente cambio mucho de el mecánica que ya él tener acostumbrado en el saga él probo algo nuevo en este juego sin duda tú sentir en el zapato del protagonista con uno aventura Pokémon mucho diferente a el de otro juego el música ser hermoso cada melodía que haber escuchar él yo haber quedar grabado en el juego él único que flaquear ser el gráfico en general apartado técnico pero a pesar de este el juego ser mucho disfrutable recomendable para todo el persona que querer ver algo nuevo dentro de el saga para aquel que querer entrar en este 
él más flojo el apartado gráfico pero para yo el mejor juego de Pokémon en mucho año Nuevas mecánica frescura mucho entretenimiento 
él mejor que haber sacar game freak en año uno refrescado el fórmula de pokémon mejorar mucho aspecto que ser tedioso en pokémon al punto que tú pregunta porque no ser siempre así que él detener ser cosa que ser obvia el juego ser bueno pero no él dar uno 10 por él que deber haber hacer hacer 5 año ojala de ahora en adelante seguir así no sacar mas basura como el remake malo que hacer de diamante per él 
el juego este bien renovar mucho aspecto jugabl quizás fatar pulir él más como el textura pero ser mucho bonito artisticamente el gente que él criticar ser porque o no él haber jugar o él tener mania a Nintendo 
mucho buen juego para ser el primero de el saga pokemon en incluir mundo abierto Aunque si que ser verdad que podriir mejorar él en mucho aspecto 
ser fan de el juego de pokemon este juego yo encanto hermoso en todo su aspecto uno nuevo diseño de nivel de explorarcion que él dar uno nuevo aire a este saga Con alguno problema gráfico pero el experiencia que tener con él ser mucho gratificante 
haber quedar bastante satisfecho con este juego yo llevar sin comprar juego de este franquicia desde el lest go él dar uno oportunidad a este de verdad que yo a encantado pero ser totalmente mejorable por obvia razón él faltar tiempo para pulir él en casi todo su aspecto pero el base de él que ya haber en el juego ser mucho buen no saber si volver en alguno próximo entrega de el línea principal pero por ahora uno Pokemon Leyendas 2 tener bastante mi atención 
el grafico ser uno desastre el tutorial ser largo tedioso hasta ahi ir el punto malo ser el mejor pokémon en muchisimos año el nuevo gameplay ser mucho divertido el mundo abierto ser basicamente él que tener que haber ser el wild areo en Espada Escudo explorar el diferente areas resultar mucho divertido el juego tú recompensar por él yo entender que no tú poder gustar pero el nivel de hate que este recibir por alguno personaje ser completamente injustificar gente que él dar uno 1 porque uno juego que no pensar jugar tener malo gráfico ese mismo gente que este bajar el puntaje del usuario de Metacritic que él molestar que el dema disfrutir uno juego 
haber ver el crítica negativo de otro usuario si bien compartir alguno aspecto criticable como él ser el gráfico haber otro que ser totalmente disparatado Si tú que aún no comprar el juego lees uno de ese crítica negativo donde considerar a Pokemon Sword Shield mejor que este juego no tú poder tomar para nada en serio ese crítica Pokemon Sword Shield ser uno oda al facilismo insultantemente fácil uno de el peor entrega de el saga Pokemon que hacer que el Nintendo Switch estar en deuda con el fan haber aclarar este el Pokemon Arceus empezar lento por uno tutorial tanto extenso que yo poder tomar hasta 3 hora completar Superado el tutorial conocer el mecánica el juego sentir que él volver adictivo no solo por completar el pokedex sino también para completar el misión secundario él volver repetitivo en uno momento sí pero qué juego de pokemon no ser repetitivo aquí él importante ser qué tanto tú durar el diversión hasta que él tornir repetitivo personalmente yo gustar el farmeo ser seguidor antiguo de el saga el juego a veces peco de mucho texto el hecho que no haber voz aún ser algo imperdonable en el época en el que vivir nintendo haber dar uno paso pequeño pero uno paso al fin Para mucho este juego poder ser uno beta para algo grande yo él estar disfrutar esperar uno futuro entrega con todo el mejora necesario para que uno juego de pokemon aspire a ser él que realmente el fan querer 
uno juego entretenido el mecánica todo él que siempre él quacer de Pokémon como el libertad el captura él sentir más fresco que nunca el Pokémon reaccionar haber animación mejor en mucho Pokémon personaje ser uno buen paso en el dirección correcto hacia el saga aunque haber uno enorme pero ese ser el gráfico si ser algo que todo hablar pero el realidad ser que el apartado gráfico él restar punto debido a que ya él haber ver mejor cosa correr en el switch Gamefreak poder tomar otro año para desarrollar ese apartado aunque si el empresa tomar ese como lección entonces esperar que el saga vaya por uno mejor camino en el que todo él ver bien él sentar bien en conjunto 
alexelcapo él que tener problema cerebral pero a mi yo haber gustar el juego 
uno juego de 10 con mucho cosa buena que deber de seguir el saga en futuro juego el gameplay aún ser repetitivo ser mucho adictivo aunque tener fallo grande como el gráfico o mecánica simple ir hacer falta doblaje en el juegos de pokémon para dar más inmersión en su historia sobre todo en escena importante o cinemática que él poder hacer pesada Si bien ser cierto que el modelo animación estar más trabajado creer que el poco tiempo haber hacer que otro cosa quedar sin pulir generar problema visual bastante importante En el historia no yo ir a meter no hacer falta que ser buen o malo cuando quedar en segundo plano aunque en término general tener diálogo más profundo que como haber decir antes mejorarir bastante con uno doblaje acorde En conclusión el juego no tener a Arctozolt así que él quitar puntuación ver Gintama 
Pokemon arceus ser uno soplo de aire fresco a el saga hacer mucho que no echar tanto hora a uno Pokemon hasta el punto de completar el pokedex en mi opinión él mejor que haber hacer Pokemon en año aún así también destacar el mal apartado artístico que tener paleta de color mucho desafortunado textura que a mi parecer poder ser mejor 
ser uno entrega diferente ese no significar que ser perfecto por que no él ser el juego yo gustar mucho encontre super que yo poder dar uno parte de este saga que salir de él tipico de pokemon mucho cosa él mantener pero él que yo decepcionar ser el diseño de el forma hisui yo enogir el falta de creatividad él mancir que ser al crear nuevo forma tener tanto cosa como referencia para su pokemón en vez de ver diseño de fan inspirar él en él decidir crear usar su pie mucho mal ese ser el punto que a mi respecta el peor adema de que no tener todo el generación que gana de poder tener mas 
él agradezar el cambio el esfuerzo por revolucionar el saga en mucho aspecto él conseguir llegar a tener mecánica por momento adictiva Sin embargo uno apartado técnico desastroso uno tutorial extremadamente largo misión secundario de recadero uno sensación de repetición que al final terminar cansar hacer que el juego él quedar a medias de él que querer conseguir Si coger todo él bueno de este entrega arreglar todo el error que haber tener poder revivir el franquicia en futuro entrega Duración aproximado 30 hora 
tras uno 40 hora jugado en Leyendas Arceus yo ver en el obligación de comentar él positivo negativo de este nuevo título en el franquicia uno en el que llevar metido desde su primero juego hacer ya más de 20 año Leyendas Arceus ofrecer uno nuevo forma de explorar capturar a el Pokémon renovar el forma en el que realizar el combate uno poco acercándono a el fórmula de mundo abierto aunque con cierto limitación Si bien el primero 15 hora él disfruté bastante pronto yo dar cuenta de él repetitivo que acabar ser llegar a uno nuevo lugar que tras uno par de hora explorar a fondo sentir que mucho espacio estar desaprovechado que poder haber él aprovechar para meter más punto de interés o que tener alguno sorpresa inesperado En el base siento que ser uno juego que de aquí a uno par de entrega ir a ofrecer uno resultado mucho firme sólido que gradualmente él acercar más al gran juego soñado por mucho de el franquicia Si mi nota no ser el más alto no ser porque no yo gustar sino porque saber que a el largo usar este base obtendremos juego cada vez mejor más interesante con más variedad de situación entorno con uno mayor inmersión más actual a nivel artístico Pokémon Leyendas Arceus ser uno juego mucho entretenido refrescante que sentar uno base para juego mucho mejor además el narrativa haber ser más interesante que en otro entrega esperar que seguir así Cosas que yo gustar que volver o estar en el futuro más combate contra entrenador Por el temática ser lógico que en Arceus no haber mucho pero esperar mucho combate contra otro entrenador en futuro entrega como en el juego anterior el dificultad él haber llevar bien en Arceus yo molacer ver él reflejado en combate contra líder de gimnasio uno liga Pokémon Modo PVP el competitivo yo ser indiferente pero molacer que haber uno forma para combatir contra otro jugador más Pokémon Por temática entender que no haber más pero esperar ver de vuelta a mucho criatura en futuro entrega de temática más moderno uno mejor banda sonoro mucho tema de Arceus ser remixes de Diamante Perla tampoco ser que ser mejor que el original ser el juego con peor banda sonoro que recordar de el saga o que ser más olvidable Zonas más variado en temática que tener uno mayor inmersión interés a el hora de ser explorado ese ser todo Si Game Freak acabar actualizar el juego que saber yo sacar modo PVP o más criatura alguno zona extra más único a modo de expansión etc quizás el nota subir Al final él que él haber faltar en parte ser cosa que ya tener que aquí él haber ver sustituido por el temática del propio juego 
personalmente este juego ser el comienzo de el futuro saga él tener mucho gana a él que él ir a venir pero este juego estar inacabado ser uno early access así que confiar que él poner más empeño hacer uno juego centrado también a gente en torno a el 18 20 año el media de persona que jugar pokémon ese no quitar que ser disfrutable pero ese no quitar que no ser uno juego disfrutable tampoco ser el peor juego de pokemon 
el principal criticar de este juego ser su gráfico apartado artístico creer que en ambos punto no haber discusión dicho este él yo hacer uno juego repetitivo con poco gancho forzarte a capturar o derrotar continuamente uno Pokémon concreto para su registro en el pokedex tener sentido pero él hacer bolo el combate contra entrenador él poder contar con el dedo de el mano el sensación de mundo abierto él perder cuando haber zona limitado uno de otro el exploración recolección de material para el crafteo él hacer tedioso por el constante ataque de Pokémon que él encontrar en el zona el juego ofrecer alguno idea buena que él deber mantener de aqui a futuro libertad de el camarar el sistema de captura o el crafteo con uno zurrón cuyo interfaz beber mucho del Zelda Breath of the wild él agradecer pero carecer de otro mucho cosa su falta de pulido en todo el sentido impedir ver el potencial de este nuevo fórmula 
yo gustar ver como Game Freak intentar cosa nuevo pero porque algo ser nuevo no significar que tener que cegarno ante su fallo el bucle jugable a él personal haber ser mucho divertido cada vez que llegar a uno nuevo zona ser increíblemente divertido capturar todo ver que haber en el siguiente zona el pelea con boss estar entretenido nunca llegar a ser realmente buena A excepción de uno mucho tardía tener cambio de calidad de vida que recibo con el brazo abierto ese ser uno poco todo él bueno él malo por desgracia yo pesar muchísimo Aunque ser divertido investigar el mapa por el Pokémon yo gustar que en Leyendas haber bueno Leyendas Ruinas explorabl interesante capaz de contarno cosa de este mundo cueva algo de trama contado por el entorno no solo por NPC ' ver alguno de el ruina más interesante de Platino trasformada en literalmente uno cuadrado donde uno npc tú contar cosa ser doloroso tener idea buena constantemente que no llevar a nada o ser desaprovechar sobre todo cuando su personaje ser relativamente carismático al menos más a él que yo tener acostumbrado pero de nada servir si el trama ser cutr maniquea o desaprovechada Que tú hacer viajar al pasado para descubrir el leyenda únicamente encuentra que tú hablar de Leyendas más antiguo ser realmente desesperanzador Por qué uno nota tanto alto entonces si tener tanto problema haber jugar 91 hora ser indudablemente divertido ser cierto que estar algo inflado por cosa como recoger el llama para el Spiritomb lento tedioso pidiéndote todas para conseguir él ser necesario para el Verdadero final al completar el pokedex haber atrapar todo el Unows sin que ese sirvierar para nada En resumen uno base buen pero ser menos de el mitad de él que poder haber ser aunque yo alegrar el cambio él celebro él quedar muchísimo camino por recorrer para sentir él uno verdadero Leyenda 
el juego ser mucho mucho disfrutable si no ser alguien que él fijir en el pequeño detalle así de simple Adictivo entretenido con mucho lorar sobre el franquicia mecánico nuevo bien pulida el nuevo Pokémon o al menos el nuevo forma ser genial casi todo Sin embargo no poder evitar fijarme en el caso extremo de popping que él ir dar frente a tu morro allá donde vayas como aún acudir a técnica de optimización extremo como el que él usar ya hacer mas de 25 año para juegos de el 64 como ocarina of temer el juego no ser capaz de tirar a mas de 30 justito FPS con bajón en cierto sitio Nintendo necesitar sangre nuevo siempre estar el señorito de turno argumentar que ' solo llevar hacer juego 3d desde el sexto gen ' hacer prácticamente uno década ya que ' no tener experiencia como otro compañía ' Pues que contratar gente talentós que haber ahí afuero con su mil de millón él pongar a optimizar el juego para que cargar por completo al entrar a uno zona que no deber ser imposible ver él que ya haber hacer otro videojuego en el mismo plataforma En poco palabras pena el jugador que entrar en mi perfil de exigencia no poder evitar fijar él en como haber invertir 60 pavo en uno juego que no ir fluido ni cargar solo él que estar a menos de 20 metro del personaje 
ante el aluvión de crítica con nota bajísima de nota con uno 10 para compensar o yo que él ir a intentar hacer uno análisis sincero después de habermelo pasado de tener el pokedex a puntito de completar Gráficos de broma el fps de el pokemon en el distancia él poder contar con 3 dedo el renderizado del entorno ser ridículo con uno popping que hacer tiempo que no ver incluso en cierto cinemática que no estar mal él ver el textura del entorno él volver cutre Si haber que poner nota uno 1 porque salir pokemons el nostalgia yo obligar dar él algo apartado técnico meh salto que tú lanzar volar alguno que otro teleport cuando desciendes  ladera pero en general poco bugs el que pasar no haber ensuciar el experiencia de juego aunque él notar que no estar pulido Sonido el nota objetivo serio uno 5 cumplir el banda sonoro sin ser especialmente épico en ningun momento si que incluir rolia clasica en el franquicia que gustar el dialogo ser a base de cuadro de ttextto sin ninguno ssonido de soportte ni cuando hablar el pokemons que no él que él costar poner el audio del PIKAA cuando abrir el boca el pikachu no tener que leer él ser ridículo ahora poder tocar el principio del himno de Andalucía con el flauta 10 10 en sonido Ambientación Not bad cuando tú hacer a el gáfico si que conseguir cierto inmersión a ratos parecer que realmente estar tener el experiencia que haber publicitar que el fan pedíamos no saber si poner él entre el 6 7 Aunque si antes ser el entrenador el que estar esperar mes en el mismo sitio a que tu pasara a enfrentarte a él ahora ser el pokemons con spawn fijo sin movilidad e interacción entre él si ese alguno que dormir poco más Jugabilidad ser mucho divertido el nuevo mecánica encajar bien yo tener enganchado aún creer que ser el primero vez que ir a completar el pokedex ya que no yo aburrir capturar por él que para mi ser el más divertido hasta el fecha él poner uno 9 Contenido no él si haber más postgame del que estar hacer pero si él que busca ser combate estrategiar por ahora no ser el juego haber 7 u 8 combate contado en el historia con el dificultad perfecto para que mi perro él jugar por mi el número de el pokedex yo parecer correcto ya que no abrumar pero él notar mucho el tijeretazo al contenido base para vender el DLC en uno mes el cual si incluir el pvp alguno modo de combate pve que asciendar en dificultad mucho a mi pesar él comprar ya que convertir este pokemon en el mejor que él haber hacer con todo su fallo pero que ahoramismo ser sólo historia Historía estar bien no ser uno peli de Tarantino pero conseguir que él prestir atención a rato aunque el incesante cuadro de texto rompar el ritmo de juego desesperan a cualquiera el tutorial ser 3 4 hora de sufrimiento pero después él abrir el juego ser mucho disfrutable RESUMEN Si busca uno experiencia parecido a el serie de el infancia con pokemons por ahí suelto uno mundo por explorar ser tu juego si busca uno rpg por turno como hasta ahora ser el franquicia no tú él recomeir ahoramismo ser uno pokemon snap con alguno combate pero con el potencialidad de convertir él en el mejor hasta el fecha por el cambio en el ivs el sistema de ataque tur yo el cambio a el MT a el memoria personalidad de el pokemons que volver el competitivo mucho mas accesible si ser que él instaurar Por él que para mi ser uno 5 6 comparandolo con el competencia uno 7 si mirar de donde venir el franquicia el cambio que proponer uno must have para el fan como yo yo doler si con nuevo contenido haber más combate uno competitivo decente que motivar al jugador a algo más que a completar el pokedex creer que ser el mejor juego de el IP hasta el fecha Perdón por el tocho esperar que él ser útil a alguien yo ir a capturar Eevees para evolucionar él 
uno juego absolutamente adictivo en mi opinión el más divertido desde hacer muchísimo tiempo él que no quitar que el apartado gráfico el físico o el historia por decir uno poco ser entre mediocr mucho mala creer que ir por el buen camino pero aún él quedar bastante por recorrer 
este juego de Pokémon yo a dejado con sabor agridulce sin duda ser el juego más innovador de el franquicia pero el juego técnicamente dejar mucho que desear además él notar que el juego él faltar medio año de desarrollo ami en uno juego nunca yo an importado en uno videojuego peroaqueaimportante 
lento repetitivo aburridisimo con uno apartado técnico qué ser uno auténtico vergüenza en pleno 3022 
no tener el encanto de el otro pokemon uno mundo tanto abierto no él venir bien 
Ideas buena pero el apartado artístico dejar mucho que desear junto al popping de elemento 
únicamente alguno mecánica nuevo salir el juego Gráficamente malo narrativamente peor uno jugabilidad excesivamente repetitivo hacer que él que poder haber ser el gran inicio de uno nuevo etapa en Pokémon quedar en tan solo uno juego mediocre Malo gráfico narrativo demasiado repetitivo poco cariño de el desarrollador por el IP bueno el nuevo Pokedex el sistema de creación de items el recolección de recurso 
ir nintendo que tú costar darno uno mejor gráfico solo para pasar el rato él ver mucho mejor Genshin Impact que ser gratis 
con diferenciar el mundo abierto más feo jamás creado ser uno pena porque en cuanto a mecánica no estar nada mal poder enganchar bastante pero el diseño del mapa totalmente vacío sin alma él echar todo a perder ya que el mayor parte del tiempo el pasa deambular por ese entorno tanto deprimente este mejorar uno poco cuando estar en alguno pueblo tú hacer pensar él bien que haber estar el juego si mantener ese nivel en espacio abierto pero ser salir de ahí de nuevo vuelves a sentir que estar en jugar uno free to play en fase beta uno pena 
por fin haber dar el paso mundo abierto el batalla contra el animal salvaje ser mucho rápido el recolección ser mucho rápido agradable poder completar entrada de el pokedex de diferente forma ser uno buen decisión ahora bien el apartado artístico ser uno desastre técnicamente no aguantar constante popeo de elemento en uno mundo vacío que no instar a el exploración el juego no tú para de llevar de el mano evitándote cualquiera sensación de libertad el lore ser uno desastre no él sostener por ninguno lado en fin él haber poner uno 6 pero ver el cantidad de 10 ' que tener yo parecer que estar ser injusto con el industria a este juego él faltar 2 año de desarrollo para ser uno 8 
no ser él suficientemente bueno Disfruté el juego pero porque pokemon ser el franquicia de mi infancia por él que si ser como yo probablemente tú él pasar bien el juego en si ser uno costra tener mucho glitch visual él ver como el culo tener uno caida de fram en el animación brutal el historia ser el cosa mas horrible plana que tú poder echar a el cara creer que yo haber repetir minimo 100 vez el mismo punto principal de el historia yo sentia tonto el mecanica de combate ser él peor de cualquiera entrega él de el turno ir fatal este explicado como el culo yo atacar tanto vez que haber vez que saco uno pokemon no poder ni seleccionar movimiento porque ya haber morir ser patetico haber algo que tú enganchar creer que ser el captura o ver el pokemons en el mundo andar pero ser que ese ya él hacia él hacer mejor pixelmon asi que este juego no tener nada este hecho sin cariño yo decepcionar en que él este convertir este franquicia pero ser el mejor juego 3d de todo el saga por él que no él que mas decir 
Pokémon ser el saga más famoso que conocer nadie que estar mínimamente meter en el mundillo él poder negar el problema ser que el que hacer el videojuego también él saber aplicar el ley del mínimo esfuerzo en cada juego desde hacer uno cuanto ya pero ser que en este ser uno pasado de rosca monstruoso yo explico ir a pasar este tema rapidito porque ser el que más destacar a simple vista pero no ser ni de lejos el mayor de el problema el gráfico el dirección artísitca el pongo junto por el simple hecho de que mi opinión sobre el 2 ser el mismo lamentable el textura estar sacada de uno juego de ps2 de el mediocr aun por encima el juego ser horrendo visualmente no ser ni bonito de ver tener uno paleta de color horrendar él único que ser decente ser el cielo que estar bien FIN el mundo Jesús bendito menudo insulto mundo abierto pero que ir llegar al pueblo que venir ser el hub entre misión e investigación llega a el puerta sorpresa Te salir uno pantalla el cual selecciona a el zona de capturar que quierar ir a él Monster Hunter pasémoslo por alto porque claro ir a explorar al menos uno zona con detalle e interés bien el primero zona ser uno pradera poder contar tú él que encontrarás 3 tipo de árbol diferente montaña que delimitir el zona uno textura de suelo PLANA mineral al cual él tirar uno pokémon él recoger él mismo con el arbol que dar baya roca de adorno igual por supuesto el Pokémons tener uno interés nulo no haber secreto no haber zona que llamar el atención el distancia de dibujado ser ínfima ser que ser uno cosa que de verdad él ver jamás diría que estar hecho por uno compañia millonario a todo el nivel ser uno falta de respeto a el fan alucinante Para el que poner de excusa ser que ser el Nintendo Switch que ser uno patato el gráfico pues cojear claro ser que el Monster Hunter Rise o el Zelda salir para PC por ese parecer que estar 2 generación por encima tanto por gráfico como esfuerzo en hacer uno mundo interesante que explorar este pokémon este más cerca de uno pokemon snap con uno mínimo historia quitar el raíl que de cualquiera otro cosa ya haber opinar sobre el saga en su momento tener que reconocer que el idea de este juego yo gustar capturar el pokemons de forma más salvaje explorar el mundo si este ser interesante el combate iniciándolo sacar tu pokemon al mundo directamente fluir pero ser que ser tener que exigir mucho más a uno franquicia gigantesco yo encantar que seguir por este línea este idea de juego el problema ser que el siguiente ser otro aberración porque saber que vender uno locura hacer él mínimo posible por el fan que él hartar a soltar 10 9 solo por ser Pokémon a otro compañia no él permitiríar este él saber conclusión Si mañana yo dijerar que el juego él haber hacer uno estudio desconocido que él dedicar a portear juego de móvil yo él creer sin dudar él parecer uno early access en uno versión mucho mucho temprano pero no ser el franquicia más grande del mundo reir él en tu cara 
el verdad el idea ser buen el cambio ser algo que rescatar en el jugabilidad para tener en cuenta en futuro entrega no obstante carecer de mucho apartado gráfico visual él notar que ser hacer con cero cariño en mucho pasaje del juego haber escenario mucho cutre ni hablar del delineado en el personaje en parte oscuro ser uno chiste mal contado no representar uno modelo artístico representar el mediocridad de el desarrollador para hacer uno juego que no tener el suficiente tiempo de desarrollo para salir en condición decente el historia pues cómo siempre dejar mucho que desear el cantidad de texto que tener el juego ser uno completo locura tanto que llegar a aburrir 
uno buen intento por innovar en el saga sin embargo ser extremadamente decepcionante que gamar freak compañia billonario no poder manejar uno buen dirección de arte 
Demasiado Fan Boy él conformar cada vez con menos así sólo seguir fomentar el malo juego de Pokémon 
ser uno juego de Pokémon tener sentimiento encontrado no poder ser que haber uno retroceso gráfico en 2022 que prometierar en uno primero momento mundo abierto él modificar a mundo encajonado él toscir poco dinámico que ser el control dar el sensación que acelerar el proceso el lanzamiento ser cierto que haber suponer uno cambio nuevo dinámico pero tener que hacer él tanto similar a Monster Hunter no tratar de ver uno fórmula propio ser uno juego que cuando él termina o él revend o él dejar en uno rincón tomar polvo 
ser uno lastima para el verdadero fanático de pokemon que en 2021 nintendo tener el huevo de sacar este basura 
ser uno vergüenza que uno de el franquicia que más dinero generar trate con tanto poco respetar a su fan como para cobrar 60 euros por uno versión alpha de uno sistema de captura el único razón por el que ser entretener que él ser ser por ser Pokémon 
quitar el gráfico penoso o el buena mecánica de cazar ser el juego de Pokémon más aburrido simple que haber jugar 
NO TIENE traducción EN ESPAÑOL DE MÉXICO Por ese él dar ese calificación por el indiferencia de Pokemon Company al país que él haber dar popularidad al idioma español en su lugar contratar traductor que adornar el texto con demasiado expresión de el calle de España que nadie entender e incluso alguno palabra que contener ser considerar vulgar para el niño de este país 
juego desfasado gráficamente en todo el sentido el único punto bueno el nuevo mecánica de atrapar combate en todo él demá mucho por debajo de todo él de haber actualmente 
uno juego mediocre repetitivo estar fatal hecho sin cariño yo parecer lamentable 
ser uno basura de 60 dólares nintendo público él que ser aún fanbar él recibir con brazo abierto 
ser increíble que pusierar este juego a el venta con el bajo calidad que tener tanto en él visual como en el gameplay ser obvio que él único que querer hacer con este juego ser aprovechar él de el fan increíblemente ciego de pokemon 
cosa que yo gustarir A MI en uno Pokemon de nuevo generación Empieza como el Arceus pero nadie tú venir a llevar de el mano durante 4h el nuevo pokedex ser mucho más interesante pero incluso él llevar más lejos yo gustar tener que estudiar a el pokemons de verdad cosa mala de este pokemon este juego reducir el fram de animación de pokemons a poco metro para que no explotar el juego que en el charla con el jefa ese el Abra tener el animación de el cola a el mitad de fram estar a 3 m de tú poco él hablar del tutorial de 2 hora que tener el Pokemon Arceus para cuatro mecánica que tener el juego Perder hora volar por el más vacio esperar que uno shiny aparezca a el dos metro de distancia de visión ser horrible en comparación a el juego clasicos yo parecer mucho completo con su fallo obviamente el tema de el Pokedex yo gustar mucho siempre hablar de mi gusto personal no defeir a gamefreak 
por 60 dólares ser uno timo no dar ni para uno beta dirio que él pillar en rebaja pero ser nintendo ese cosa no pasar aquí De mal en peor Gamefreak superar su nivel de ineptitud con cada entrega de el saga para comenzartién uno tutorial forzado el cual ser absurdamente largo gráfico arte al nivel de uno Indie de bajo calidad uno jugabilidad no aprovechado el critica positivo en su mayoría ser de fanboys de Nintendo en general argumentar que ser uno pequeño paso llevar decir ese desde que el sago abandono el 2d 
Vergonzoso acabado técnico Texturas mucho pobre Mecánicas aburrido repetitivo 
uno mundo abierto mal aprovechado no haber nada que hacer mucho espacio vacio graficamente mucho por debajo incluso para el bajo estandar de nintendo sin detallado el entorno que en todo el mapa solo haber 4 arbol clonado por todo lado espero mejore pero de momento ser uno juego no terminado a mi gusto 
bastante bueno optimizado ojala tener mas potencia el Swich pero ser bastante bueno como ser 
tener uno Bugs que hacer que el juego ser horrible no ser idiota no comprir ese porquería o basura el gráfico parecer que él hacer niño japonés de 5 año 
el diseño del mapa ser pésimo sin zona que él diferencien uno de otro ese hacer que tú pierdar porque todo él ver igual para orientarte deber abrir el mapa porque no haber minimapa el gráfico ser feo aunque ser raro porque en contado ocasión no él ver tanto mal el distancia de dibujado este vez mejorar para el pokémon ya no hacer popping a el 5 metro como en swsh pero hacer que el objeto a el distancia él ver como cartón el historia ser igual de simple que cualquiera otro juego de pokémon Spoiler Solo haber uno pueblo solo haber 180 mov no haber habilidad el diseño nuevo de palkia dialgar el nuevo djin del trio de el nube ser horrible 
el nuevo mecánico uno despropósito que no aportar absolutamente nada al juego con total seguridad ser eliminar en el siguiente entrega de el saga principal Gráficos no malo exageradamente malo peor que cualquiera otro juego que haber probar en el último 10 año Artísticamente peor que todo el entrega de Pokémon incluir el que no ser de el saga principal Gestos facial corporal inexistente movimiento como cualquiera alpha técnico de hacer 20 año caer por uno barranco ser lamentable no ser estable el 30 fps Poca variedad contenido Suena bien pero al tener tanto poco variedad él hacer cansino a más no poder todo él que él poder esperar de el que más dinero generar en el industria uno reir él en el cara de uno fandom sin el más mínimo vestigio de amor propio 
Pokemon Legends Arceus no llegar a llamar él Pokemon no él llegar a publicar nintendo absolutamente todo el mundo él estar poner a parir el nota estar por debajo del 5 Nadie él estar jugar si este mismo juego él llamar Monster Legends Arkeos ser uno juego FEO el paleta de color ser deprimente haber jugar juego como Genshin Impact que ser precioso el mundo si que él sentir vivo quien decir él mismo de Arceus ser que no haber jugar juego de mundo abierto en su vida o no conocer juegos fuera de Nintendo yo dar muchísimo pena que Pokemon estar llegar a este nivel de mediocridad gracias a uno estudio como Game Freak gracias a el fanboys que él conformar con cualquiera mierda si el switch tener suficiente potencia para mover DOOM Eternal no yo jodir haber que recordar que ser uno juego AAA que él vender por 60 eurazo no ser uno juego indie Game Freak no ser uno estudio de 5 persona sino de 200 que menos que exigir uno mínimo de mimo que desde luego no él ver por ninguno lado el jugabilidad ser tanto penoso que el personaje no poder ni saltar el gameplay ser insulso repetitivo a mas no poder el misión típico de uno juego de hacer 10 año el personalización del personaje dejar mucho que desear Si alguno fan de Pokemon él conformar con ese tener mas de hater que de fan porque no él estar hacer ninguno favor llevar todo mi vida imaginar uno Pokemon con el gráfico de Genshin ser MMO o multi como minimo pero con este gente ser imposible que ese llegar a pasar menos mal que estar TEMTEM que ese sí ser uno juego indie él follar a Pokemon en absolutamente todo el aspecto Pero claro no él llamar Pokemon no ser de Nintendo Eso ser todo 
no yo vengar con el imbécil nintendero que ser uno buen juego ser solo uno lamesuela de nintendoestá basura tener mucho por mejorar además del apartado gráfico a este altura ya ser obvio que uno switch poder ejecutar gráfico mejor Fans pendejo empresa multimillonario cagándolar otro vez 
ser el peor pokemon que haber ver en mi vida el grafico ser él peor que haber ver en todo el historia de el videojuego no él compreis ser uno insulto para el fan de pokemon 
el juego definitivamente no ser uno 0 pero él hacer para nivelar el ridículo 10 falsificación de cuenta de youtuber famoso De igual modo ser decepcionante como uno de el compañía más poderoso del mundo no poder dar uno producto de calidad a su fan ser que ser uno juego para niño NO importar Si él poner a dar ese excusa justificación juego como Mario odissey Mario kart animal crossing tener uno calidad tanto deplorable como el de este juego 
uno juego decepcionante apartado gráfico de risa jugabilidad el mismo por turno pero al menos ahora ser uno mundo abierto tener excesivo diálogo que el primero hora de juego tú él pasa más hablar que explorar ese mundo abierto aunque el historia nunca a ser el fuerte de pokemón ser increíble que hacer algo tanto malo creer que todo tener en mente el pokemón perfecto este juego querer hacer ese pero el resultado a quedar horroroso por favor Gamefreak ponlir gana 
ser uno vergüenza para el videojuego que este cosa tener mas de uno 2 ser uno juego simple fácil si yo decir que ser uno juego de ps1 yo él creer 
este ser uno vergüenza este juego él notar que no él haber terminar él faltar por pulir él este ser uno bochorno de juego 
si este juego él hacer Sony o Microsoft él llevar uno 6 en metacritic pero como ser nintendo su nombre ser Pokémon 
ser uno gran juego uno paso gigante a el franquicia de pokemon implementar nuevo función mejor nunca antes visto en el saga ser uno maravilla tanto en el aspecto tecnico como grafico 
el juego ser uno maravilla Al final tú acaba perder por el diverso mapa capturar sin parar recoger objeto hacer misión yo parecer que haber ser mucho acertar el manera de evolucionar el saga que haber elegir Game Freak él malo él que ya saber todo el mundo el apartado gráfico no aprobar ni de lejos no yo quitar el sensación de que estar jugar algo que tener mucho posibilidad pero que no él acabar de explotar Si para el siguiente entrega arreglir este cosita tener mi diez 
imperdonable que pokemon sacar uno juego con cero esfuerzo Empresas indie de 3 persona hacer juego con mos cariño esfuerzo detalle que uno empresa multibillonario 
ver este yo imaginar a el ejecutivo de Nintendo reir él en uno despacho porque a pesar de haber sacar uno juego CUTRÓN en cuanto a gráfico jugabilidad e historia él estar vender como churro ver este comentario en rrs yo parecer el más acertado 
el problema principal no ser solo que tanto gráficamente como artísticamente ser malo además de ese ser uno juego con bugs que llegar a duras penas a el 20 pfs que realmente parecer inacabado Si él tratar de uno early access no costar 60 euros poder estar bien ya que tener buena idea pero mal ejecutado 
el grafico penoso juego de dinamicar mucho lento en el sentido que demasiado texto para poco jugabilidad para mi opinion haber perder el esencia de pokemon yo esperar uno mundo pokemon como el demas juego pero en mundo abierto mas actual no que siempre querer empezar en llevar yo a epoca antiguo cuando él que querer ser algo moderno bueno para mi haber ser uno decepcion 
sinceramente él pero que haber ver mejora uno poco en mecánica pero nada mas gráficamente él peor solo buscar sacar dinero dar mucho pena 
uno vergüenza para haber él sacar uno compañía multimillonario como Game Freak Modelados pésimos paleta de color horrible mundo vacío repetitivo combate vs boss que dar gana de llorar el excusa de que estar hecho así porque el Switch no dar para más tú recordar el existencia del Zelda Bote En resumen parecer uno pre Alpha de uno juego indie no yo creer que haber trabajar en este proyecto más de 5 persona todo estar hecho con desgana encima de no haber ni profundidad en el mapeado ni distancia de visión que tú popear el árbol Pokémons a 10 metro suerte encontrar uno zona que no ir a 15 FPS Si no ser uno Fanboy de Pokémon con 2 dedo de frente defender él indefendible ser imposible dar él ni uno aprobado a este estafa 
ser uno beta que vender por 60 euros el gente él excusar decir que el gráfico no él ser todo menos en Pokémon pero ese gráfico no ser que ser malo ser uno basura el juego ser mucho repetitivo no haber vida en el mundo el personaje ser piedra que no él mover él que decir uno beta que vender cómo uno buen juego 
el primero 4 hora ser uno tutorial lleno de texto explicar él mecánica básicas que cualquiera persona aunque tener problema motor serio poder descubrir ejecutar por si mismo 
Juego Mediocre No solo ser el malo grafica su mal diseño artístico ser uno juego hecho sin amor 
si tener 3 año de edad mental estar guay suponer Si tener criterio algo de amor propio jugarás a cualquiera otro cosa 
yo considerar fanático de el sexto generación hacia atra debo decir que a pesar de que el saga siempre haber saber como mantener el malo calidad este juego haber ser uno paso en el dirección incorrecto el mapa de Husui ir a 3 fps ser extenso como uno hoja gigante de papel blanco 
ser feo pero feísimo Repetitivo hasta él absurdo el juego tú tratar como si tuviese 4 año el pelea de boss ser él más aburrido que haber ver en el vida 
Malo como pegar él a tu madre feo como uno blasfemia 4 cosa uno mundo vacío uno desperdicio de mecánica ausencia de carisma en su personaje uno apartado artístico pobre 
uno juego mucho pobre tutorial innecesariamente largo para explicarte 2 mecánica el juego él ver bastante feo en general opción a elegir en conversación donde si eliges 1 no pasar nada tú obligar a elegir el otro el gente esperar uno buen juego él encontrar con este bazofia 
este juego este mucho mal hecho haber poping en el textura el colisión estar mucho mal hecho poder interactuar con uno puerta desde el pared de al lado tú él vender como mundo abierto pero en realidad ser uno juego estilo monster hunter ser decir mapa semi abierto ser abierto si pero no ser uno mundo abierto el juego consistir en atrapar el mismo pokemon mil vez para avanzar en el historia para mi el sacer perdio todo su magia en el entrega de 3DS 
si salir 20 dólares estar bien pero vo estar cobrar uno juego a 60 dólares con uno visual que yo dar dolor de ojo literal uno gran basura 
poikemon ser uno juego rpg no ser uno juego de combate de accion no ser uno dark souls el combate contra el jefe con ese nivel brutal de dificultad arruinar totalmente el juego 
le jeu commencer par nous mettre le doute au début quand on se rendre compte que graphiquement être vraiment pire que ce qui se dire mais un fois imprégné de son gameplay on être foutu je être à 84 heure et ce jeu ne me lâche plus ' être tellement prenant et addictif avec ce envie constant de savoir quel Pokémon manque dans mon pokéde et comment le passer en complet un plaisir après 80 heure que je vouloir retenir qui avoir effacer le premier heure de doute face à ' aspect visuel 
très bon jeu enfin un jeu pokemon avec de vrai contenu un jeu où de fun peu être sentir qqch que je ' avai pas résenti depuis pokemon noir et Blanc 
excellent très bon renouvellement de le licence en espérer que cela continuer sur ce lancée 
un expérience nouveau addictive même si le graphisme laisser à désirer 
au que dire de Légendes Pokémon arceus bien que le jeu être clairement en retard sur le partie technique avec de trop nombreux défaut sur ce point le jeu offrir un véritable sensation ’ aventure dans un monde Pokémon qui commencer à être plus vivant et plus réaliste ’ action de jeu être beaucoup plus fluide sans casse de rythme et plaisante à découvrir ’ histoire bien qu’ lui reste simple ’ être pas inintéressant et offrir de combat particulier et fun pouvoir être un peu trop facile le jeu en reste pas moins un excellent base pour un nouveau série de jeu à côté de le série principal ou un source ’ inspiration pour celui ci Full test > > > 
excellent jeu pokemon dans le fait que il renouvell grandement un licence essorer déjà depuis bien longtemps certes le graphisme ne être pas bon mais le animation et le DA former un ensemble qui tendre à équilibrer ce immense défaut le scénario être prendre le personnage être bien mieux écrire que le 3 4 de reste de le licence sans que celer être parfaire malgré tout le musique présente être vraiment chouetter même si lui avoir tendance à rester discret pendant un bon partie de ' exploration 
un jeu Pokemon qui apporter un nouveau mécanique et un façon de jouer comme on en attendre depuis longtemps ' être un bonheur de pouvoir se balader dans un zone ouvert avec le possibilité de rencontrer et chasser le pokemon à vue dommage que le technique de base être rater ' espérer que game Freak conserver le point positif de ce jeu pour son futur jeu me point positif un jeu Pokemon en temps réel tu croise un pokemon tu peu ' attraper directement ou ' affronter ' univers dans lequel on être plonger ' humain craindre le pokemon par son méconnaissance de celui ci ce qui rendre le jeu plus sérieux un difficulté plus relever qui accentuer le côté Pokemon sauvage et dangereux que le jeu vouloir véhiculer de bon ider pour améliorer ' ergonomie de jeu menu agréable gestion de capacité plus simple évolution maitriser le déplacement en monture le point ' effort au lieu de iv ev un zone ouvert dans lequel il être agréable de se balader et croiser un pokemon ou autre on pouvoir capturer réellement tout le pokemon disponible sur un seul jeu le système de craft le combat de boss accessible à tout via le option recommencer depuis le début ou à partir de le jauge actuelleMes point négatif le réalisation technique au niveau de graphisme clipping et le ressenti général être mauver ' aime pokemon mais à certain moment on sortir juste de ' immersion de jeu ou on arriver pas à retourner un étudiant en école ' animation 3d pouvoir aisémer trouver le nombreux défaut sur le jeu le quête secondaire inintéressant aucun intérêt de le faire sauf celui qui améliorer le boutique ou champ de récolte le quête de récolte de 107 flamme de Spiritomb qui prolonger artificiellement le durée de jeu quand ' histoire principal être finir ou au bout ' un certain temps vous devoir juste indiquer le localisation de celui ci le jeu être déjà assez moche pour ne pas avoir envie de ' balader trop longuement et en plus le distance ' affichage fait que le flamme pouvoir mettre de temps à apparaître même à 3 mètre le système de perte ' objet qui être juste pénaliser si on ne posséder pas ' abonnemer onlin 
point positif tentativ de renouvellement de le licence honorable le zone ouvert le crafting le monture quelque bon ider parmi le quête secondaire le DA être plutôt sympa et avoir un énorme potentiel le technique le vide ne luire faire pas honneur point négatif le technique très mauvais qualité de texture clipping aliasing et pas de tout à le hauteur de ce que devoir proposer un de licence le plus lucratif le monde manqu cruellement de vie le pokemon être poser là à attendre que on le capture ce qui ressembler plus à un zoo que à un terre sauvage trop de sentiment de sécurité et il avoir être appréciable et plus immersif que le pokemon mener son vie chasser se battre se cacher jouer 
alors que dire de jeu il être pas mauvais mais il avoir pu être clairement mieux on ce sentir très vite dans un espece ' espace vert simulator ou un no man sky avoir ce début de vide de vide et rien que de vide zero dresseur avoir part dans le scenario avec de le cinématique avoir ne plus en finir juste pour combler le manque de contenue voila le jeu ne mérite pas un sale note mais ce être clairement pas le jeu Pokémon révolutionnaire tant attendre espéron que ce jeu être juste un phase test pour faire patienter et que le 9 gramme être avoir le hauteur de notre attente avec ce gameplay 
je donne un point pour le renouveau de le série qui arriver enfin à évoluer dans le bon sens tout le reste être négatif on avoir le un bêta Difficulté toujours ridicule techniquement avoir le ramass monde vide scénario gaga pokédex peu généreux pas beaucoup de chose à faire au final en espérer que le prochain pokémon Legends être plus travailler 
le jeu être terriblement nul le mécanique de combat être sympa mais ce jeu pokemon être sans dresseur à affronter sans univers à explorer sans histoire sans fun sans arène sans fun sans ville sans fun ' être un ramassis de terrain moche le jeu être plus un clicker que un rpg avoir ce stade 
un véritable hont le jeu ' être pas finit et mérite encore plusieurs année de développement sans parler de ce bug de ce graphisme vomitif et de son frame rate qui peiner à tenir le 30 fp GameFric ne devoir plus avoir le droit de toucher à ce licence 
Gerçekten bayıldım en sonunda hayallerindeki oyunu yaptılar puanı çok daha yüksek olmalıydı harika bir oyun olmuş
"ini adalah langkah yang bagus untuk seri pokemon karena mereka membuat langkah yang baru dan memperbaiki semua hal buruk di seri sebelumnya,untuk grafis mungkin bisa sedikit lebih ditingkatkan tapi overall sudah sangat memuaskan"
Graphics are bad but other all of things is perfect just buy it.Grafikler oyun için eski ama kendi içerisinde bir sanat tasarımına göre yapılmış bu onu çok kötü kılmasada botw örneği maalesef hep düşündürüyor. Ama onun dışında bir pokemon oyununda keşke bunlar olsaydı dediğimiz herşey var alın abi
"Oyunda eşşek var bu en önemli sebeb , 2.si oyun yıllardır beklediğimiz pokemon oyunu olmuş durumda."
a fun reinvention of the Pokémon formula hopefully the next version keep this change while give it a well look 
a fun challenge at time Pokemon game with an addictive gameplay loop and an interesting system of fight and catch Pokemon it ' a huge step in the right direction the graphic performance and multiplayer option need work but those be the only major flaw the story pace battle catch mechanic exploration and general gameplay be such an improvement over Sword Shield and Sun Moon there be major series change that make big difference in quality of life such as no limit to the number of move a Pokemon can learn they just have 4 memorized pre battle and not have to trade to evolve certain Pokemon anymore use rare item on they instead Exploration craft gathering and find rare and shiny Pokemon have never be this fun go be much of the tedium and boredom find in previous game if you care only about graphic or online competitive battle you will find reason to not like this game but if you be into the collect aspect of Pokemon you will love this it ' worth note that the graphic and performance issue be much less noticeable when play handheld 
good pokemon game of all time New pokemon new stuff to do new way to catch pokemon and well gameplay 
one outstanding experience that be certain I absolutely love the direction GameFreak be go for with this whole new installment for the Pokemon series and it be very refreshing while be very need at the same time Catching Pokemon in this game be more fun than ever and I ' a fan since the first era with the FireRed LeafGreen version it ' way more than a nostalgia trip it be a brand new experience and I sincerely do hope that we will see a big sequel to it because the game really deserve one with further gameplay enhancement maybe a big map with more activity cheer to all the hater 
incredible game that move the Pokemon series forward in a fresh new direction the gameplay loop be fun and while the graphic aren ' great they be more than fine Gameplay should always take precedent over graphic and Legends Arceus be a joy to play 
I m so addicted new mechanic and idea be really fantastic can ' stop play it over 40 hrs and still can ' put down the console the world be really beautifull exploration be truly amazing the only grip be the performance and graphic but the game have it own graphical moment must play for sure 
this be such a spectacular evolution for the Pokémon franchise from the first few moment you know you ’re step into a new fresh take on the series and the game continue to surprise time and time again even into 40 + hour of gameplay 
a delight to play this game perfect evolution of the saga with a magnificent exploration complete the pokedex be very satisfying unlike in traditional pokemon that be more of a nuisance than anything else graphically it be not bad at all but that be the least important it ' fun it ' addictive enjoy 
this be the good Pokémon game I have ever play to I it feel like what I think I be play when I be a child 20 year ago but without have to imagine so much 
I will get this out of the way the graphic be the only thing imho that need polish but they be still servicable I been play the game for over 10 hour and honestly most fun I have in year with a Pokemon game this game be test ground for future Pokemon game in this style so let ' put the graphic aside for a moment and look at the big picture here aside from graphic do you want more Pokemon game like this I sure do that ' why despite the graphic need more that this game deserve a 10 
excellent step in the right direction for Pokemon do not listen to the bad review they be weak and shall be forget 
finally this be the change in the saga what the true consumer demand hope the next generation with 1000 pokémon will be full open world and the good gen of all time 
a game with terrible graphic and technical issue but extremely fun and addictive gameplay this be the right direction for Pokémon it ' so much more enjoyable than the boring exploration and battle of Sw Sh and explore craft discover new Pokémon it ' a blast also the 0 10 review be from people who obviously didn ' even bother play the game and be just hate on it because it look bad in the trailer and they don ' like to be wrong 
overall this game be a breath of fresh air it bring new element and life to a system that have otherwise overstay its welcome for the last few decade I genuinely hope they keep this fusion of RPG turn base system for Pokemon game to follow as it allow the player actual choice and actual exploration that feel rewarding to I whether that be in the form of find rare item or pokemon spawn I never feel it be pointless to actually touch every corner of the admittedly large segmented area as for player choice there be many time I have a marker on the map which indicate where I need to go to progress the story which I just ignore you can explore catch and train pokemon at your own pace which as most Pokemon fan know isn ' the norm you can find rare item pokemon alpha pokemon and everything else freely from your second time step into the field which be really nice ontop of that there be multiple way to complete your pokedex you can battle you can capture you can observe or you can raise they yourself and learn thing about they you will see a lot of people on here say it feel tedious but they have option they just didn ' explore they or take the time to read they of course there be a graphical downside but I honestly never feel like it hinder my experience throughout my play through it be an area they need to work on though go forward without go too much into it since I want this to be a spoiler free review this game be amazing I can ' understand people who be try to say this be the bad Pokemon game to ever exist it be far from the bad and easily rank as one of the good imo I really hope they intend to keep this formula because I don ' know if I can revert to the old system in Gen9 after experience this this be a fun game and if you actually read into the mechanic and into the side quest they give you a fun idea of the NPCs take on the world your character and many other aspect a lot of fun Easter Eggs be in the game too so keep your eye peel for those 
good pokemon everhistory 10 10gameplay 10 10ost 10 10art graphycs 7 10 + 1 for funny 
the good pokemon game so far the world feel immersive the gameplay be fun and escape the old formula which be get stale after every game be near enough a copy paste of the last 
I have play literally every Pokémon game over the last year I still remember sit in the car as my parent get I and my sister a Gameboy Color and a game for each of we Pokemon Red for my sister Pokemon Blue for I I always have my rival grow up try to catch more train hard just over all be the well Pokémon trainer than my sister she fill her Dex before I but I have the first lvl 100 Pokémon I ' old now internet have definitely impact my personal connection to the Pokémon franchise because it make I feel less connected to individual but Pokémon Legends Arceus bring the personal connection to Pokémon I ’ve miss for so long over the year yes I love the old mechanic but after 20 year of they I do think it be time for a fresh start and Arceus do just that I see this game as Gen 1 of a whole new Pokémon experience and in so I feel like this game be to be more fairly compare to Pokémon Yellow I ’ll first touch on Multiplayer since I see most complain on the lack of multiplayer but this game be not a game mean to have all the fancy online feature that take away the true soul and heart of Pokémon the reason we all attach to the original game it be the connection we have with our Pokémon and trade Pokémon that feel you get when a companion you work hard on leave your party you feel it battle will be come but they need to build the world for us first Arceus need to be see as a foundation for what can come and I truly believe Gamefreak see it the same way think about it the game start off with we be send into the past before Gyms before Pokémon center before even people and Pokémon achieve harmony the world isn ' empty it ' just fertile and ready for a civilization to be establish Jublife City be just the start Mechanic wise this game revolutionize how to play Pokémon be able to run and throw out your Pokémon leave and right to gather material cycling through they as you get in a rhythm and collect even fast because you have your Pokémon help getting catch by a Pokémon and throw out yours just so you can actually run away a good distance away from the Pokémon attack you no more hit Run away button for I throw all six of your Pokémon out so they can interact with each other or even run into the toward the enemy Pokémon as you tell your Pokémon to attack the mechanic let you interact with your Pokémon in so many way my rating be technically 9 5 for this game but it ' a damn good start for the next generation of Pokémon 
the Pokemon game I have be wait for since I first watch the anime as a kid visual be a little lacking but everything else be amazing 8 10 inflate to battle the troll 
it ' be a long time since I have pick up a pokemon game Think alpha sapphire be the last one I remember pick up pokemon red and it have come a long way after play this game all I want now be for they to do the remake of the Kanto region with all the original pokemon 
a refreshing new take on the series the ball catch mechanic be great and I love the option the game give graphic could be well but the story be also very good 
this be a new masterpiece bring to the pokemon community I will try to go over the positive element and thing to improve on I will also try to make it free of spoiler too but thing to improve on you have rate this game 10 and it have thing to work on sure do I ' rate a game base on the fun I ' have and the urge to continue play and both those thing be over the roof I ' have a blast and the people around I who buy it too seem to be in the same place so this be totally worth a 10 in my opinion be I give this a 10 just because it be pokemon absolutely not Pokemon in the last few year have be hard to finish in the sense of get boring before you get to the good part the end game let start with the positive Catching mecanic be really fun use item to lure in stun scare pokemon while have new pokeball that play with distance and surprise be a blast even if I have every pokemon in my pokemon home up to this game I ' enjoy catch everything I see for the first time in year try to catch a pokemon by surprise be also really rewarding and fun overworld use of pokemon be able to chose which pokemon to throw in at any time be really interreste like prepare the right pokeball in case something go wrong when catch or know a pokemon of a certain type be hide somewhere and use the good pokemon to uncover it craft and in game economy be meaningful the world be full of resource to look for and the money have its use so you don ' hoard it Pokemon have be give too much to player in the last few game to the point where it ' hard to spend it all Pokedex feel like you be really work on it as it be not fill itslef on its own with just 1 encounter while a good portion of it just fill itslef while play normally I often stop to check on the pokemon in front of I to see if I can work on something the pokedex progression be also the game progression and it really feel like a fun goal to work on Combat some base element make it more refreshing like status effect for example none of they last forever anymore but they have some other effect like the new sleep drowsy that make the pokemon receive more damage this make such move more interresting in the previous game I be run around with a thunderwave pokemon and catch most of my stuff with that the strong and agile style be interresting combine with the combat timeline it ' refreshing while stay close to tradition iv ev be gone replace by a new system that be simple although I didn ' mind the old system it be a bit tedious and get redundant for I so I welcome the change here breed while at first I be shock that it be remove be a boring portion of the game in my opinion while I would not mind have it back with a bit of rework I feel the game be well without it for this iteration Alpha pokemon really fun little challenge to catch these everywhere Love it shiny hunting be now fun in this game gosh it ' weird to say that thing to work on the story while it be a good story for Pokemon I ' not feel bored like previous recent game but I ' not feel like I want to rush to know what ' next maybe it be for the well though because I have take my merry time to explore and experience the world and that be fun Competitive they really need to bring battle between player in the future it feel off to not have that option and it a fun part of the endgame to build a good team to battle Graphics I ' not sure why so many people complain here the graphic be ok even if not on par with game like breath of the wild they be still ok Pokemon have never be praise for its graphic the lightning seem off in some place or when it rain but other than that it ' totally fine battle with noble pokemon while I do like the general idea and I ' have fun during these battle its a little offset to throw food into a pokemon ' face to calm it down like hell I would calm down if you throw I my favorite food in the face the idea be fun to play but weird as a concept Inventory I don ' mind move thing to storage and manage my inventory but surely some thing can be do to help that process same for pokemon box I guess I feel I miss a couple thing to improve the usage of both of these 
100 adicte I love pokemon play since Gen1 but I do not enjoy the game since and now I m hook the quest the new pokedex mechanic the pokemon roam its all so much fun for real giv it a try you will not regret it 
this be a huge step for turn base rpgs its open world simple yet difficult at time and for a company that only really make hand hold game it a huge step there be negative here but come on its a fun fresh new turn base experiance that I theory should get well 
I be really dissapointe with every mainline Pokemon game on Switch so far let ' go and BDSP be inferior version of FRLG Platinum imo and SwSh really lack when it come to explore and content over all therefore I can ' believe it that GameFreak finally do it again they finally make an awesome Pokemon game again the new catch mechanic huge area to explore an interesting story in term of a Pokemon game a lot of side stuff to do etc now that ' what I call a next level Pokemon game graphic could be well but they aren ' bad either up close they can look really nice but it ' the draw render distance that could be well overall it ' the good Pokemon game since ORAS imo and every Pokemon should definitely pick this game up you win ' regret it 
Oops GameFreak do it again it ' be awhile since GameFreak release a good Pokemon game the last one be Pokemon Emerald obvi Holy Arceus I don ' know why it take sooooo long for they to release another masterpiece I be excited to see this formula milk for the next 2 decade I think look forward to Pokemon Legends Kyurem or Deoxys 
this be finally the game we should have get a long TIME AGO seamless battle great world to explore a bit of freedom in how you want to tackle thing this be for I the first real 3d pokemon game there be some flaw the pokedex be not that big the move selection be a bit shorten and there be quite a lot of repetition an lack any form of PVP even casually but aside from this this be the good pokemon experience so far 
this be the good game GF have make in more than 10 year I hope they continue in this direction 
this be everything I imagine Pokemon to be as a kid while there be some thing I think need an adjustment the entire game be absolutely refreshing I love be able to find shiny Pokemon in the wild just sit there if this be the future of all Pokemon game I be absolutely on board definitely my favorite game yet 
the Pokemon game we need I recommend it for Pokemon fan as well as those who have never play a Pokemon game 
I would guess most people that be rate it low for graphic haven ' play the game be it unreal engine 5 no but it have its own stylization charm and the visual be not nearly as bad as some people be claim Ground texture could be well but other visual be also quite attractive the change the game bring the stunning and clean UI sound music map and unique story all excel so far I know Game Freak and the Pokemon company probably have the money to hire the good of the good but maybe they don ' want to do that and support grow the team they already have if this be a giant leap forward for the innovation of Pokémon game I can imagine the future will only get well decide for yourself watch stream if you need a well place to form your own opinion and be open to different gaming experience 4 k hyper realism doesn ' need to be the standard for every AAA game 
Great Pokemon Game a must have role play game for ur Nintendo Switch the gameplay be amazing as well 
it ' just amazing this be the new beginning for pokemón series off course graphic could be well but you forget about that quickly when you start play 
this be my first Pokemon game and I just want to say that it awesome I never believe that I ' say such a thing this game make with love to old school pokemon fan and newcomer 
despite its graphical problem this be the way of the franchise should walk it ' a must to all pokemon and rpg fan 
I enjoy it very much I love all the change they make to this new Pokemon game Best Pokemon game in the last ten year 
do not believe what rat fan boy say about PLA its a great pokemon game the graphic be not good its a 2 gb graphic card but the big step its do I love the game it have everything that fan need 
where to start yes I get why people don ' like this game because of the graphic however for someone like I that have grow up with Pokemon Red in the early day it ' a 7 year old child dream come true I love this game so much when I play it I feel 7 year again play Pokemon Red for the first time on my Gameboy Colour Nostagic aside the gameplay be super fun everything feel so smooth running throw a Pokeball to a Shinx and immediatly after that catch another one its so addicitive and fun to play I be only in the first area and spend 15 hour already for people that not like this game ask yourself the question be you really a Pokemon fan because I don ' get why you can hate this game graphic aside Gamefreak finally shake some thing up and hopefully they go to improve this concept far with more gameplay option and much well graphic I be go back to fill my pokedex 
ignore negative review with 0 rating they be make by a handful of miserable people who set out to review bomb this game 
it ' not about the graphic it be about the feeling the gameplay and be a true RPG Pokémon fan 
the most fun I ’ve have play a Pokémon game since FireRed Refreshing and highly addict gameplay I hope Pokémon continue in this trend go forward 
Don ' let the hater detract you this be what we ’ve be ask for and it ' amaze the primary reason so many be upset be that it be not everything we want all at once but what it do do well be introduce a dizzying array of long hold change we the core life long fan have be ask for a giant leap forward and make what ever game come next already top of my to watch out for list lastly no matter how you cage it gamefreak and a Pokémon Company have build a much more mature story as ask and put together a UI UX design much close to the tv show then any previous game to date play it for yourself than judge 
amazing game bad graphic but be the way that gamefreak must follow to do the perfect Pokemon 
Pokémon have have a rough transition to 3d between the game get easy to the point of be braindead the fact that route feel less like place to explore and more like corridor with occasional wild Pokémon battle and the design that keep get bad and bad with each new generation the crack in the seam become a lot more noticeable this reach its peak when the series make its proper jump to the Nintendo Switch with Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield direct by Shigeru Ohmori cut about half of the Pokédex only to sell it back to you later down the line and just generally look like an upscaled 3ds game and then we get the long await Sinnoh remake with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl direct by Junichi Masuda only if you want a Sinnoh remake that actually improve on Gen 4 ' foundation you be never go to get one until modding get more advanced so with Ohmori most likely work on Gen 9 and Masuda attempt to polish up BDSP enter Kazumasa Iwao director of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon the first game in the 3d era to actually feel like a game and I think it ' safe to say that if anyone need to be the director of future Pokémon game it need to be Iwao as Ohmori and Masuda be hold the series back this be the big jump that Pokémon need and I ' say it deliver yeah the visual aren ' that great and the game can either feel grindy or like a collectathon but with every Pokémon you catch you be make progress through the game I ' currently about to start the 5th area and the only reason I didn ' make this review soon be that the game be too much fun this game could very well shape up the future of Pokémon so do you want more visual novel with occasional monster catch element or actual game to sink your time into if you want the latter then buy this game 
so so good Gamefreak really outdo themselves this time and it ' about time they do I can ' recommend this game enough if you have get tired of burn out on the usual Pokemon formula 
compare to the previous entry in the franchise this be one hell of a game in a really good way 
Great Game a new experience I love Pokémon and I love nintendo exclusive Buy now my friend 
this be the good pokemon ever make it have fault but compare it to the old game it be clearly the good game the people give it negative review be clearly people who just be not into pokemon and just want to jump on the gamefreak lazy hate train everyone I know who love pokemon be play non stop I be someone who get the game early and I have battle arceus it be one of the most fun boss battle iv ever play and this game overall be fantastic 
be a solid 8 a great evolution but I m give it a 10 for the review bomb you mad that we be have fun uwu 
Perfect even both graphic and world blurry or bad texture I approve the experience to play pokémon as breath of the wild Zelda 
this be the kind of Pokemon game we be ask for year since Pokemon Black and White the franchise need a change and here it be 
this game be fantastic yes graphically it could be well but at least for I it doesn ' effect my entertainment level in this case the thing that be really matter to I be just how much fun it be once I have start it be hard to stop for hour it have a gameplay loop that feel good and be very much a just one more thing sort of loop this be no doubt my favorite Pokémon game to have ever release and I hope that the next big title learn from this game Pokémon be back baby 
it have some problem sure but boy be it fantastic make all Pokémon game like this from now on please 
the only thing this game could improve on be graphic this be a huge step forward for pokemon 
this be the summation of various concept that have be cook up within the franchise over the year a fantastic game that know what to innovate and also know what to keep personally I can ' get off the screen of my Switch because catch pokémon and fight with they against all kind of wild creature be totally stimulatinggame Freak deserve all the love for this 
graphic aside I think that this be the good game of the franchise by far 
amazing gameplay feel fresh and make you really feel like you ’re interact with the world and Pokémon 
Most fun I have have in a Pokémon game in year explore the different area and complete Hisui ' Pokédex be so addictive I hope future installment build on what ' currently set by legend Arceus 
the game even factor in the technical issue be terribly good I couldn ' imagine a more immersive setting and gameplay the smoothness of the gameplay loop be ridiculously good I ' truly have fun like the the first time I play a pokemon game and re live the wonder I feel diving into Hyrule in Botw this be a 9 6 round up because some detail in the shadow should ’ve be deal with properly the rest be pretty much everything you ’ve ever want and a little more 
game be extremely fun be play Pokemon since blue red yellow come out and this be a really nice turn they achieve it ' totally different then your traditional Pokemon game and I love it wide open world Pokemon everywhere it ' what I have be wait for since a kid as what other have say graphic be a bit meh but it ' still really fun dangerous change they do and imo it work let ' hope they improve upon this for the next game 
love it this new direction be great and I hope Game Freak expand on it the gameplay be unique and only Pokemon be capable of make this work 
Best Pokemon game this be the way there be no way back this be what Pokemon need 
this be the way that pokémon game should be the graphic be not that bad and actually it ' a sort of unique for Pokémon game it ' amazingly satisfy 
this game be an 8 but because it look like they finally listen and there be a lot of pointless 0 I be go to give they a 10 I hope they continue down this path and continue improve the franchise they need to put more effort in the graphic I love the style but there be a lot of graphical problem also make the world feel more alive with more interactive pokemon and npc also I want to see more dungeon and cave more move and see how they improve the battle system more 
this be easily one of the good pokemon game release in year highly recommend to anyone 
the gameplay itself be so addictive innovative and good that I rate it 15 10 this equalize the downside of the graphic that be only sometimes bad in general graphic be actually good and similar to Breath of the Wild Sound be good e echo in cave and different great music in situation like nearby strong enemy finally I can love Pokemon again all last 4 game before be bad finally a masterpiece the game mechanic itself be fun enough to keep you play 
easily the good Pokémon game that have come from GameFreak all the new mechanic work and flow really nicely yes the graphic aren ' amazing but for what they be they be good 
the evolution the franchise need Hope the next game follow the same path as this one 
I be absolutely addicted fantastic shake up to the formula and the good Pokémon experience by far to date 
the most entertaining Pokémon game ever there ' so much do right that can make I forgive the one big problem the underwhelme graphic other than that it ' a perfect game 
it be a very very bold move of Game Freak in change the entire formula of a succesful franchise like Pokémon I believe this be just the begining of a new generation of Pokémon game and I ' so happy to be a part of this the game be awesome fun and beautiful Don ' listen to the hater some be just graphic weebs or people who doesn ' like good change enjoy this adventure 
the good pokemon game I have ever play the innovation in the game be very successful Gamefreak have show we what he can do whenever he want 
a total step in the right direction the game be not perfect but as a first iteration in something new it come as close as it can I haven ' be this engross in a Pokemon game to where I will spend many hour at once play in quite a long time 
the graphic be not great aside from that this be one of the most enjoyable Pokemon game I have ever play it might be the most enjoyable People be really give it zero just because they don ' like the graphic or the new form 
I ’ve be tired of Pokémon game for a few year now but I love this game from start to finish this be the perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation it ' not perfect but it be a huge step in the right direction I hope this will continue to be the new style of game that game freak make because if it be I ’ll be there day one for all their new game 
game be an 8 but because it be the good of the series it get a 10 in my book lol 
good Pokémon game since Pokémon black and white I like the new action and stealth element in the game 
probably the good Pokémon switch game yet definitely the most fun anyone who be complain about graphic or lack of Pokémon need to see this as the good jump forward for the video game franchise Brilliant 
great stepping stone for the franchise hopefully gen 9 build on this everything in the world be so seamless and fun that you can sink endless hour 
good Pokémon I have ever play no doubt I mean seriously this be the change that pokemon need 
an incredible game this be what pokemon lack it ' funnyAn incredible game this be what pokemon lack it ' interesting and funny I really like it a lot I really like it a lot 
this game be what Pokemon nedee for the future please do not be a one OFF 
the good Pokemon game yet definitely worth the time and money investment it be definitely a step up for the developer at Game Freak I look forward to what they will bring we in the future they should be very proud of this entry into Pokemon canon 
muito bão mas muito bão mesmo isso sim very good be forever now game its play nice camon inthe game very well in the world chapion easy boy be definitive game note maxima inthe game family 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be easily the next evolution in the series present an experience that blend element of action rpg and open world adventure title make for a highly rewarding game for series newcomer and true believer alike the graphic and gameplay be among the good the series have to offer make this a must own title for Pokémon fan and switch user everywhere 
so far I have play 20 hour Haven ' finish the game yet but dude this be amazing I be a bit worried it would get repetitive but honestly the gameplay be so fun and it feel so rewarding to fill up your pokédex that it doesn ' feel repetitive at all there ' so many side quest it feel I could keep go and go forever and always have something to do the new battle mechanic be incredible the most fun Pokémon battle have ever be what a shame there aren ' more battle tbh the game be also quite hard find my Pokémon faint a lot but not hard to the point where it ' unplayable or annoying it ' just the right amount of balance between easy and difficult you can comfortable play it let ' put it that way see the Pokémon in their natural habitat be so refreshing feel like a playable version of Pokémon Snap the gameplay be fun the story be original the character have charisma the customization option be great more unlock whilst you progress in the game the craft be cool and even though the graphical aspect isn ' the good admittedly it honestly do not take away from the gameplay at all it be just that fun at no point do I feel like the graphic be worsen my experience and since the artstyle be beautiful you don ' even feel like the game be ugly but yeah consider it be never a bother I don ' even want to lower the score because of it so far it ' the only flaw I have find if you be a Pokémon fan you will love this if you be not you will probably like it too 
good game of pokemon in a long time the change the formula a little an it work nicely a lot of story and new mechanic make this game perfect I hope that it will be a new line of Legends game in other region 
all I can say this game be a breath of fresh air 
absolutely revolutionary for the pokemon franchise I love every bit of the game this be certainly a step in the right direction good job gamefreak 
much well than the last remake and for I be more appealing than sword and shield I have play all the Pokemon game from red to the last remake and this feel like a breath of fresh air of course graphic be not great but I know that a have Nintendo switch with half of tflop of a regular PS4 at least it run o 1080 dock 
its a refreshing pokemon game that feel so much fun the mechanic be so good and catch all pokemon have become so much immersive than ever before Hope the series will continue this open world feel 
amazing game a complete revamp of the pokemon game concept though the graphic be slightly disappointing this game more than make up for it in sheer fun 
by far the good Pokémon game of all time it ' far superior in any way compare past game to this be ridiculous 
I have play it for well over 20 hour and I have barely scratch the surface of it great value and it ' quickly become one of my favourite if I ' be honest it could become the very first but I haven ' finish the main story yet 
this be the good Pokémon game since Soul Silver Pokemon game should have have this type of gameplay since the switch to 3d graphic this spin off be well than most of the previous Pokémon game and Gamefreak should focus all their attention on make Pokémon game in this style from now on 
love the total shift in the gameplay right from the start could be visually well but in the end gameplay win which be streamlined and fast in PLA Super addictive and time just fly while enjoy the exploration hopefully this gameplay mechanic will be see through new pokemon game and I hope as much that there will always be main line pokemon game also 
you can say what you want about the graphic not be perfect but the game experience Pokemon Arceus deliver make it by far the good pokemon game of the franchise 
very enjoyable game thus far the good game in the series no doubt I ' convince the people spamme the game with 0 score review haven ' even touch it 
it could be well but rate it 10 so game freak realize this format be have a lot of potential so they make a sequel 
to be honest I expect less however right at the game entrance I be amazed to see how diffrent the game feel I think that PL Arceus would be lackluster and new fighting style of Pokemon wouldn ' be as entertaining and simply win ' have the same effect nevertheless I be prove wrong I could 've write even more about this masterpiece of a Pokemon game but I be too lazy 
addictive game I love explore sneak around throw stuff collect item actually the craft feature be very fun one of the good game I ’ve play 
good Pokémon game I ’ve ever play it switch up the formula in way the series desperately need and lay the groundwork for more innovation in the future 
this game be the good pokemon game I do not know why people hate it I can promise this be a masterpiece First at all everyone say the map be empty and just catch or fight in game play I agree with the point but the situation only appear at your initial initial period in initial period the tutorial teach how to explore the without any function such as swimming climbing and fly when you get all of it you will very enjoy the pokemon world there be the new fight system new gameplay style these good thing be all pokemon fan want so this be a good pokemon game it also mix with breath of the wild style and I very love it though someone say the graphic be bad I have to say pokemon be a videogame and the videogame its mission be funny and make player enjoy I think game freak have be finish their mission get the great result 
this game be amazing play 15 hour of it and I be have a blast and probably will be play it for much long 
I be fascinated with how new this title bring it ' be 12 hour now and I can ' stop play the music and sound of nature be immersive the world be wide and fun to explore you can make your own tool the story be interesting one of the good Pokemon game in year 
I have be play since Red and Blue and this feel like the first time that I have have that level of interest and enjoyment from play a pokemon game the new mechanic be great which leave to a very engaging and addict gameplay loop there be some nice quality of life improvement but most importantly shiny hunting be really streamlined and feel more obtainable rather than do an obscure shiny hunting method TL Dr I recommend this be you love pokemon but want a fresh change 
excellent game ideal for people of all age in its main story it may seem easy but in its huge post game be where it keep the challenge for the most experienced in Pokémon 
remarkable game and that everything it do have a function within its proposal and system with an enviable exploration and a way to interact with pokémon like never see before the big problem it have be the mostly negative fandom in which attempt have be make to discredit it everywhere unfair and incoherent comparison have be make with other game and they have seek to glorify indie that blatantly plagiarize Pokémon as well when in fact they be inferior see TemTem or Nexomon out of simple hatred and resentment for a national pokédex none of this help they because the game turn out to be the opposite of the malicious prejudice that be be form well make gameplay that meet in be fun Objectives and mission not be repetitive at all Excelent music good story good difficulty curve Good artthere be many thing that Arceus legend do well 
very good game I didn ' really like what TPCI GF give we over the last few year but this one be very different the gameplay feel very new and different but do not eliminate the important element for pokemon Catching and Stealth system feel very fun the difficulty of the game be not too difficult nor too easy but there be some battle that feel difficult the main thing be that finally GF put effort into the game itself 
honestly I love the game its mechanic be dynamic and realistic and there be so many quality of life improvement the story be really nice and for the first time I ' really excited to complete the dex the boss be challenge and the game in general be incredible in my opinion I don ' find the graphic to be bad they be a natural progression it ' a top game a must have 
arguably the good pokemon have be in about 20 year with clear influence from game like Monster Hunter and Breath of the Wild Pokémon Legends Arceus give you the freedom to explore that you wish you have in Pokémon Snap with all the attraction of a main series Pokémon game and more 
incredible how Game Freak manage to use a whole new playing method different than the Pokemon formula they use in the previous game and still manage to do an incredible work in my opinion easily top 5 Pokemon only behind masterpiece such as Platinum and Heart Gold 
an incredible evolution for the Pokémon franchise the graphic need to be well but the game be amazing and you can spend hour and hour just have fun the new battle mechanic be great the capture mechanic be really good as well 
the game be a bold step towards a well future for the franchise its super fun expansive lot of thing to do story be well than previous main entry etc it still have room for improvement specially when it come to the graphic and other technical aspect but if we be go to get more Pokemon game like this in the future I ' all in 
I have a really fun time play this game Graphically the game isn ' the good and I have to say I be pretty upset with the fact there be no online battle but this be set up something fantastic for the future of pokemon I m really excited of what s to come 
the Pokémon game that I want since my childhood it ' so addict the game reward you for everything I ' love this game so much 
quickly become one of my top 5 Switch game I hadn ' play a Pokémon game since Diamond but this one be make I a super fan 
this game be really cool the mechanic be complex enough to make success feel rewarding but not tedious at the same time it have what you love about a Pokémon game rework without all the repetitive stuff the gameplay loop of go out and research Pokémon and then come back to the hub to manage your inventory quest etc be addict the performance be ok it doesn ' ruin the immersion but it could be well this game have a lot of variation it ' really an experience and give the same feeling I feel when play other famous switch title I ' look forward to see the publisher build off this formula 
when I be 10 year old Pokemon Blue and Red Version be release on the Gameboy Pokémon Legends Arceus be everything that I imagine blue version be while play all those year ago in my opinion this be the great thing to happen to the franchise 
I ' glad we finally see some ambition graphic drop this game to an 8 or a 9 if you be not a Pokemon fan but I ' give it a 10 because I want all the next Pokemon game to be as ambitious as this one 
incredible game the good in the franchise mix the great mechanic from pokemon and open world game in general 
it be simply awesome the new mechanic be very fun and very welcome after 20 year of the same formula must buy on the switch 
please don ' pay attention to the minority of poor review on this game needless to say give this game a 0 isn ' an accurate and give no insight to how good it be for someone who have play Pokémon since the very beginning this game be what I ’ve want since I be a kid I ’ve already put 20 hour into Legends Arceus and I can ' wait to continue play 
I have be very prejudiced with this title and with its studio this game take the idea of catch pokémon to another level that we have never experience in the main sagai love how you can fight with any pokémon and that the battle environment be the same overworld the difficulty be quite decent imo despite what some say about its graphic they be actually lovely 
the good Pokemon game of all Franchise new formula and everything in this Game be a hard work of Game Freak to bring we Legends Arceus I can ' stop play 
this be what the franchise and the fan need amazing open world fill with Pokémon well recent pokémon game by far 
I never expect a pokemon game to grab I like the day of old be sort of go through the motion with previous title of the mainline game but this one have I go deeply into it great to see the change graphic be damn if the game be good it ' ok it ' not the pretty one at the PokeBall 
[ SPOILER free review]overall this game be pretty good even though the graphic and texture be not the good they be still okay on the other hand they put a LOT of effort into the character model pokémon and animation in general the gameplay mechanic be also really refreshing compare to the predecessor and the story doesn ' follow the typical Pokémon formula [ evil enemy team get all badge beat the champion ] I barely encounter any bug and even when I encounter one it wasn ' anything game breaking and it didn ' disturb that much all in all I enjoy this game a lot especially because my expectation weren ' that high so I be really surprised when the game turn out to be good important to know be that Gamefreak barely make any game that weren ' top down perspective before so it definitely lack some depth in term of world design but that will definitely get well the more game they make in this kind of style it ' really hard to change a whole developer studio workflow just like the old pokémon game the graphic will probably get well from game to game about myself the only Pokémon Games I have play be firere let ' go and Sword Shield because I ' mainly a pc gamer I know that there be thing miss from old Pokémon game but from a non biased non nostalgic perspective it ' definitely an enjoyable gameplay experience 
well I think it ' the good Pokemon Game since Gen 3 Story be great for a pokemon game too 
the game be a step in the right direction anyone who give it anything under a 7 5 either didn ' play it or just a hater throw out 0s all over 
20 hour in and by far the good Pokémon experience ever the only drawback in the game be graphic but consider the game development cycle be only an year I don ' mind it the character story Pokémon and soundtrack be great as well but definitely the good part of the entire game be the gameplay they completely revamp the Pokémon Gameplay and it be worth it 
it ' the GREATEST Pokémon main series game in history a little lacking but graphic be more advanced than the previous series vast and moderately divide territory fun to collect proper fusion of exist series and action boss of various pattern sub quest that do not interfere with main content and dramatic story how can this game be boring I be able to feel with my whole body that GameFreak work hard 
awesome game I recomend it for all pokemon fan Innovative game ❣ ️good job GAME FREAK 
love the game not the good graphic but a step in the right direction I love be able to roll off mountain I do wish there be a jump button but I be enjoy the game right now and I can ' wait for a future version 
just good there aren ' many other word to describe how well Game Freak have manage to deal with a new style of game after polish and improve the current system for year its a game that everyone have to play only play it be understand because despite the average graphic one fall in love and have it fix on the screen 
to limit the quality of this game only to the graphic be to think in a very reductionist way it be to limit the discourse in a mononeuristic direction that do not benefit anyone or seek any solution only to complain in a destructive way without any reason this game be surprisingly fun vast and full of thing to do once you start the journey it ' hard to get off until you finish it the prejudice that the general community have for the game could not be well describe than with the word Unfair play it and you will know what I mean 
Pokémon Legends Arceus innovate and move the Pokémon franchise in many way Pokémon battle transition seamlessly take place in the overworld and only happen when you throw out one of your Pokémon ' Pokéball this remove annoying random encounter but there ' still danger to traverse the wild Aggressive Pokémon will attack you it ' pretty difficult Battle animation have receive an overhaul and now look super cool and actually run over and hit each other they be also properly sized and wild Pokémon be now more powerful there be side quest as well this be a super good game that you should buy 
a game completely up to the circumstance and that meet every expectationPokémon on Switch be simply on fire with each game the franchise get well 
one of the good game that Game Freak have make along with Emerald Platinum Ultra Moon and shield+expansion the leap in quality they have make in such a short time be incredible 
this game be exactly what pokemon need be not perfect but the new mechanic and the freedom be too good imagine explore Kanto with this formula please gamefreak this be the way 
I have be tell that it be a game very similar to BotW but when I finish it last night it be the complete opposite this game do have a good story devoid of filler character if it have a world with interesting thing to do more than the empty plain of the game with which it be compare and instead of be fill with hundred of shrine and kolog each Pokémon to catch be a new experience and challenge without fall into monotony I love Pokémon Legends and everything that be propose and the comparison seem more than hateful to I it have nothing to do with BotW nor will it have it its a game that in its own style know how to stand out and be memorable 
I be love it the battle mechanic be fun the only downside for I be the graphic overall a breath of fresh air for the franchise 
great game get it right now grrrrrrrr you well buy it because it ' good and my review be this long because I can ' make it short 
good game ever I really love the graphic and everything about it ' great this might just be my favorite game of all time 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be objectively the good Pokémon game since HeartGold SoulSilver since the series gradual decline into stagnation and mediocrity start with Black White it feel like there be no hope for Pokémon game to be good again each title be get bad and bad then come Legends Arceus a brand new spin on the tired and overdone Pokémon formula with a world that actually feel open and alive and gameplay that doesn ' bear you to death Legends Arceus also bring a plethora of actual QOL change to the franchise that Masuda and Ohmori be hesitant to bring such as be able to learn move whenever you want and completely rework the terrible bloated EV IV Nature system that Ruby Sapphire introduce Kazumasa Iwao be the kind of person that need to be in charge of the main series Pokémon game from now on the fact that SwShills be attack this game for actually have an ounce of effort put into it and actually well be a good game just show that Legends Arceus be the kind of change the series need Hopefully Generation 9 will follow in the footstep of Legends Arceus 
Gameplay be incredible it ' a mix of Zelda Breath of the wild exploration in the vast over world and Monster hunter style concept with the Pokemon charm totally blow I away the story be top notch the good Pokemon game ever release it ' everything I want Pokemon to be when go 3d 
huge step in the right direction with PLA as a foundation the future of Pokémon game look bright it ' not perfect and I understand the qualm regard the graphic and lack of voice act however this be a MAJOR improvement over the lackluster and lazy Sword Shield and I be have a blast if you ’re on the fence I recommend give it a chance I would ’ve give it an 8 or 9 but since so many troll be review bomb it I ' bump it to a 10 to try and balance it out Most fun I ’ve have in a Pokémon game since Red Blue 
normally I ' give this game a 8 but since everyone be give zero 
this be the good Pokémon game I ’ve ever play it ' everything I always dream of since I be a kid play Red Blue yes the graphic could be well but the game be so much fun that it make up for it I ' so happy that Game Freak finally leave their comfort zone and try something new I ' in love with this game and can ' stop play it 
this be the pokemon game I have look for since a kid despite the bad graphic this game be insanely good for I 
overall this game be a great stepping stone for the Pokémon Franchise as a whole the mechanic and gameplay be phenomenal and I feel this be a great starting point for the game go forward all of my friend who have pick up this game absolutely love the game and be have a blast anyone who have rate this game a 0 you be just review bombing this game you have absolutely nothing to complain about Nintendo do a great job show off all kind of different video show off gameplay 
Best Pokémon Game in a long long time a fresh take on Pokémon be just what be need good gameplay 
I really like it it may not be a graphic masterpiece but it ' a lot of fun the change be positive and because they be positive they tend to stay and be improve in the future do not take seriously the opinion of those who have not play and simply say that it be not worth it because of the graphic you can be sure that if someone say that the game be not good because of the graphic that person do not play go play and see how fun the game isIt ' an important step for franchising they have be try to evolve a 25 year series and they be on the right track think so Pokemon Legends Arceus can almost be call a successful draft I highly recommend it to anyone who be a fan of the franchise who doesn ' play pokemon and doesn ' have the weight of nostalgia probably win ' be enchant by the game 
this game demand improvement and it be not perfect however what it be be a game fill with wonder exploration and fun a hope for future entry to build on top of the foundation that be Pokemon Legends Arceus and join other a list Nintendo game such as Breath of the Wild Metroid Dread Xenoblade 2 and so on PLA steal my attention with its smooth and seamless gameplay numerous side mission and monster to tame absolutely gorgeous music along with a difficulty curve that be refreshing for long time player seek a challenge Alpha Pokemon be especially fun and quite the challenge and have I go oh * * * * oh * * * * oh * * * * the first time I run into one Graphics be lack sure but not nearly as bad as some may say in fact some area be beautiful enough to be worthy of a screenshot the art direction be reminiscent of ancient japanese ink painting which I believe be deliberate consider the era in which PLA take place anyone who have play Okami will surely recognize this style this be a game that can prove to denier that graphic be not solely what make a gaming experience great or special I be 15 hour in and still without face the first noble and have not feel any inkling of boredom in the slight I can easily see myself spend many hour explore and discover give this game a go it be absolutely worth the price 
I usually don ' leave rating this be a solid 8 10very addictive obviously there be some issue include the lackluster graphic the barren landscape etc give it a 10 to counteract the 0 3 score give 
Pokémon Legends Arceus manage to re work the stale formula of the mainline Pokémon series which hasn ' be well receive in nearly two decade the game find a way to blend more Pokémon go esc mechanic with the traditional Pokémon battle system almost seamlessly into open environment to the point where I never get tired of try to catch everything I could find unfortunately the game do have to make some sacrifice to allow for its likely short development time due to the Pokémon Company ' eagerness to get game out quickly this be most apparent when judge the game from a graphical perspective which for a game that feel like it should like nice due to its attempt at BOTW esc environment it absolutely fail look at it more as if BOTW be for the Wii although do keep in mind that footage of the game likely look far bad than the game itself since for example Youtube compression hardcore mess up the grass additionally there be only about 240 or so Pokémon which be seem a little disappointing but consider they actually give they new animation and work they into the game ' world that much more would just feel impossible to implement in only a few year regardless of its flaw the game still come out to be a ton of fun with its new gameplay loop and intriguing story and still earn a high rating in my book 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be a great game amaze open world feel like a true RPG catch Pokémon be well than ever Pokémon model be great the Pokémon battle be amazing this game be a new positive direction to the Pokémon franchise also the exploration be amazing and be very rewarding the rank be nice Arceus be a great visual game with the mechanic of the game not be repetitive at all the story be great and the unique pokemon to the game be the most coolest thing you ever see Overall Pokémon Legends Arceus be one of the good Pokémon game ever that I recommend buy 
the fan can never be happy this game be fun and can bring new fan this game do not repeat what the last previous game have do only problem be that it do not have good draw distance however this game be fun well then other game and will always be criticize because fan be not happy to get what they want Sword and shield be not that bad of a game People who do not play these game also criticize without proof angry joe be definitely one of they because he claim this be for kid yet he play animal crossing so rating 9 5 but definitely a 10 because of its good story 
the new system give very new fun the fun of collecting have double than before Difficulty level bring interest to the game 
Best Pokemon game in a decade this be what fan have be want for year the catch and battle mechanic feel so good 
what an amazing game the gameplay be just so fluid it be the first pokemon game that make you want to complete the pokedex this game be a wonderful step forward to this franchise the difficulty level be just perfect you can get over level but the wild pokemon constantly tag team you make it a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 the great flaw of this game be its graphic some texture be actually really ugly the move be actually pretty beautiful but sometimes the tree or even the pokemon be not that good look besides the fps constantly decrease but not in a way that bother you a lot since the game change a lot the core mechanic this game be easily the most noob friendly game of the franchise make the player learn about pokemon as they play overall pokemon legend arceus be a fantastic game with fantastic mechanic it ' the close we ever get to the dream pokemon game it ' not a 10 10 because we know the graphic can be well but every single aspect of this game make I want to play it even more update what a fantastic end arc now this game be indeed a 10 10 
excellent game visual do not distract from the incredible gameplay flow the good story and gameplay loop the series have ever have 
a new world to experience Love the new feature it ' worth my time I really enjoy it 
the gameplay element be very fun and interesting in this game and be a big step forward for the series though the graphic could improve 
Botw graphic + the pokemon we always want I hope gamefreak continue this way and make a AAA game with this formula 
a really nice game for anyone who have be complain about these game for the past few generation 
Most fun I have in a while with a pokemon game the new mechanic be really cool and it really feel like you be a part of the game huge step in the right direction and I m so excited to see what they will bring in the future 
graphic do not make a game people expect to much people call themselves pokemon fan but can not see the potential leak out of this game for the future great game it take the good of let go part and the main series game and throw they together in an exciting way I ve put 20 hour into the game so far and stilll get excited everytime I see a new pokemon the distortion rift add a fun way to get rare item and pokemon that make sense to the story as well as gameplay the dodge machanic be also a feature that work well from the story let you know that the world be dangerous and we do not know much about it Music be great Gameplay great Story be great 10 10 game imo great change for future title in this 
this be the most interesting game the graphic be very good and there s be funny asdfk 
a perfect example of Pokémon and it ' what I want after see the first episode of the anime even with the technical limitation of the Switch it expand the series in a great new direction and set a roadmap for the future 
fun 11 10 we all have eye but gameplay ist still the most important think and its great Botw feeling 
Best Pokemon experience I have have since b2w2 I start the series with Yellow so I be ecstatic about this direction 
good game of pokemon by far this be a great change for franchise we have to support this type of big change and not destroy it with ridiculous rating without non sense 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be the great surprise for I in the last year of play Pokémon I expect a game with small content horrible graphic and a middle quality gameplay what I get be a lot of content graphic that be okay and a gameplay that have a high quality than I could dream of I really hope that we will get a second part in a few year because I didn ' feel such a joy while play pokémon for at least the last ten year 
this be format I ' like to see for future Pokemon game freedom to explore no tedious walking through grass and constantly encounter Pokemon the effort point system be mile ahead of the old system change move on the fly in the menu be amazing the only downside be that it can be hard to see some Pokemon from a distance also move forward we should go into a more voice act approach for these game because it can seem a bit quiet 
Thought I would not like it turn out to be one of the good switch game so fae 
this be by far the great Pokémon game ever make I really hope they continue the trend of do corresponding Legends game for each exist generation 
by far one of the most enjoyable Pokémon game I ’ve play go all the way back to Red and Blue I do miss have a lot of trainer battle however the new mechanic introduce in the game and the story have make the game very enjoyable I hope they can continue off of this game and make more with the new feature that be introduce 
Arceus be the game we ’ve all want since we be little I ’ve be play for 20 year now and this be a refreshing and exciting take on the franchise 
the gane be awesome this be the Pokémon what need to transform in a well experience 
good pokemon game of all time Chupem hater Mandaram muito bem dessa vez 
as a lifelong fan from play Pokémon yellow at 5 year old to Pokémon legend arceus wow just wow okay this game if you love the franchise or even new beautiful addicting gameplay that offer an amazing experience 
insanely good game it ' a really unique and amazing experience there be so many cool new feature that could partly even make it into the main series because of how good of an improvement they be I m not even close to finish the game especially storywise because I m busy complete dex entry but I can alr tell you its more than worth it to check it out huge recommendation even to non pokémon fan 
I now have 18 hour of gameplay in the new Pokemon and it ' more fun than it ' be in a long time the fluid gameplay between catch fight and explore be just awesome yes Gamefrak didn ' put much effort into the graphic and prefer to put their resource into the reorientation of the gameplay that would be the only point of criticism for I otherwise the new Pokemon convince I all along the line 
it be very close to the Pokemon game that everyone have dream of for year it be a rather innovative game compare to the usual main series in which the company act boldly the quality of the animation this time and the fact that it offer a very fluid game experience in the open area be the aspect I like the most I really like this game 
hand down the good Pokemon game ever make it ' everything you ever want can ' wait for this series to continue 
of course that ' not my true rating but until people will be allow to vote 0 which isn ' realistic for any game I will have to give a fake vote for balance it ' an addictive game and really fun despite technical blunder 
a fantastic departure from the same ol tired formula it may not be the most visually impressive game but graphic never make a game truly great to begin with the poke collect adventure battle all feel fresh and fun the world be incredible and all the lore tidbit be go to please any long term pokefanatic 
the good Pokemon game ever make finally after 26 year gf shake up the formula and it work the game look terrible but it ' still a masterpiece 
Best Pokemon game ever really lay the groundwork for the future game Free roam be what we have always want and the update to the move pool system the graphic everything be awesome only wish HP be keep the same 
this be a step in the right direction hopefully they incorporate some of these mechanic into the next generation 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be not only an incredibly fun game it ' an incredibly fun Pokemon game that mean something especially when up until now release of new Pokemon game have go more stale than old bread it change almost all the mechanic which make the Pokemon game monotonous and tedious and change they into really fun mechanic it ' story element be very well mixed into gameplay and while the game be not on par with the like of fable or Skyrim as rpg it be still a fun experience and a definitive step in the right direction if you haven ' try Pokemon yet this be the game to try if you be a long time fan of the series like myself you will feel a sense of astonishment that a Pokemon game can actually be enjoyable Game Freak and the Pokemon Company have finally listen to fan woe it must be note that the game ' graphic can be hit or miss at time with some animation look like stop motion this hasn ' take away from the experience though 
fun new Pokémon experience I think the graphic get entirely too much hate aside from one particularly ugly cloud everything look nice and have a watercolor sort of feel to it can easily sink over 50 hour into it and the core gameplay loop be fun 
one of the good Pokémon game ever it ' a breath of fresh air to the series that long overdue all though the graphic lack 
good Pokémon game up to date I ' really enjoy it from the gameplay to the mechanic everything feel fresh 
this be the good Pokémon game they have ever make and if they do not iterate on these system I will be disappoint 
it feel really amazing to actually have a new Pokemon game where I don ' already know how to do everything before I even start capture Pokemon be a whole new experience the fighting be more dynamic and way less straightforward the progression be very Zelda like where you be more of a Pokemon Researcher than a trainer overall this be the good way this franchise could possibile grow so excited for the future 
personally I think Legends Arceus be the good Pokemon game since Gen 3 I ' not state that gen 4 + be bad just that gen 3 be my favorite game until now could change again not entirely sure I ' enjoy it a lot 20 hour in so far here be the highlight for I so far * although it ' not go to win any award the story be the good a Pokemon game have do in a long time * catch mechanic be amazing no more go into a battle to weaken they and then throw a pokeball just hide toss wait and repeat if necessary there be some limit and exception though * there ' something very satisfying run across a Pokemon you didn ' know be in the game or that be a rare spawn Pikachu Eevee Chimchar etc be all available in the first area * you can choose when to evolve your pokemon once they have meet the requirement * you can switch out move anywhere at any time as long as the pokemon know they no more forget move and have to reteach they if you mess up * Boss Encounters be fun and challenge at time although you be not go to lose anything if you die * a specific mechanic no spoiler that open up mid story be very challenging if you want to go after they for the rare item and spawn * Alpha Pokemon be very fun to fight and catch they have the high AI in the game and be actually smart lol * personally I like the graphical style they choose again not go to win any award but I like it 
honestly its not perfect but it be so lovable and have a charm similar to the original game I spend so long do side quest find Pokémon in new location and finally catch hard to get Pokémon honestly the game feel so good and alive be critical of Pokémon since ORAS but this be a great experience for a hardcore fan like I 
it be one of the good Pokemon Games ever I have now over 20h playtime and be do with the main story and it be sooo funny yeah the grafic aren ' the good but the mechanic be so smooth and it feel so good to catch pokemon or farm resorce I hope that the incoming game be like this 
I love the idea it make I hope for a well future also the nature be not perfect but for a switch I think they do a great job and I be go to wnjoy it 
good pokemon game so far and most relaxing and explore be also fun and graphic issue seem nothing 
the game be the must fun I have with a Pokemon game in a long time it shake up the formula in the right way keep thing interesting and make you think about how and when to approach pokemon the only downside be the graphic it should have be well and I think it could have well if they dedicate the game a bit more time of development I ' give it a 10 even with its flaw because I hope they will use this game as the stepstone to build future installment rather that go back to the old formula for the next generation of game 
good job I be enjoy this game a lot this be the way Game Freak have to take maybe the graphic be not the good but the rest be so fun and enjoyable sincerely I love it 
one of the good game and one of the good Pokémon a serious candidate for good RPG at the Game Awards 
this game revitalize the Pokemon formula with ton of new idea and advance for the franchise have not enjoy a pokemon game this much in a long time and I have play every generation of pokemon since gen 3 the gameplay loop be engage and really inscentivise catch as many pokemon as possible sidequest be pretty diverse and never feel like copy paste of each other also every npc in jubilife village have a name and feel like a real character and I love that 
this one of the good Pokémon game that have ever be make the game play be fun the story be one the most surprising aspect of the game Don ' listen to the negative review there be lot we can take from this game and what can come in the future there definitely improvement on the game but I truly love it and have be have play for day now 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be everything that sword and shield wish it could be I say what I say 
the pokemon be so cute and there be many new thing to check out love this 
this game be exactly what the franchise need to finally step out of its niche I know lot of people be criticize graphic but the graphic be honestly pretty decent you have get to remember that this be a Nintendo switch not an Xbox Series or a PS5 I have go about 30 hour into the game and still haven ' complete the story meanwhile I know people who have beat the story after 12 hour which go to show that you can really set the pace in this game with dozen upon dozen of side quest a fair sized Pokedex to complete and a beautiful story Pokemon Legends Arceus be the next step in the Pokemon Universe and I ' truly excited to see what the next step the franchise will take 
in my opinion this be the good game that Pokémon have do since Gen III and the most creative period I say that as someone who have play every generation and enjoy all of they somewhat it really capture what people should expect from the franchise and I hope it set the standard go forward the new battle system be fantastic the art direction work well and the gameplay be honestly pretty engross 10 10 
Best Pokemon experience ever good mechanic Great Gameplay nice back up story 
Gamefreak ' first big deviation from a very successful formula while still utilize the part that make Pokemon so great graphic not stunning but they do not detract from the experience Gameplay the flow between battle and open world be seamless no more wait 10 second everytime you encounter a pokemon as someone who start with 1st gen and quit playing due to pace issue after gen 3 to pick it up again recently the pace feel much fast than any game since gen 3 set Design the design of the region Pokemon have a old world theme to they the rest be as you would know and love except Garados fly though the sky like a Boeing 747Story while I have not finish the game yet it be not the same story that have be in every Pokemon game past gen 2 no boring badge hunt instead we be fill out the pokedex to gain star within the faction Best feature everything to experience be contain in one game not two title with Pokemon miss from each Summery I think this be the good thing that can happen to Pokemon it feel like a step forward for a franchise that have stick a new coat of paint on the same game for the last 20 year I hope this stick and become the new standard for the main line of Pokemon game 
I really love the game it give I the good old feeling of be a chad and have a thick but good time 
this have to be my favorite Pokemon game of all time and I be not even that far into the game yet easily put this game into my top 5 game of all time the exploration be very rewarding along with be able to pace break the game give some trial and error regard catch rate the overall theming be absolutely wonderful and be able to interact with your Pokemon in new way be always a nice and sweet thing to do absolutely recommend to anyone who be a Pokemon fan or enjoy collect a thon or open world game 
I think try something new in a pokemon game be awesome and this game give as so many new feature and a new style 
amazing game love capture all the mon explore complete side quest and more the story be really cool there be explonation for some of the thing that be in pokemon bd sp like why spear piller be in ruin and how the reigon get the name shino it ' just wonderfull Obviusly this be not the perfect pokemon game but it ' close some of the thing I wish be a litle well be the graphis wich aren ' bad just not as good as I want so yeh greate game do recommend 
New Pokémon be refreshing change of pace on the franchise great play experience with the new catch mechanic 
everything be in place here if only they have work on the visual more and add some form of voiceover it would have be 10 10 it be a pity because the next game in the series will not be that big moment for the franchise anymore no matter what it look like it ' like a waste of opportunity to impress everyone and sadly great gameplay be overshadow by visual problem for I it ' still the good pokemon game since gen2 
I absolutely adore this game i‘ve been play Pokemon since I be four and diacovere every single generation but couldn ' really enjoy anything that come out after and legend Arceus on the other hand give I a sense of immersion no other Game Freak game have create the game as a whole just work perfectly within its own world Sure the graphic win ' win price but they also didn ' bother I and the gameplay more than make up for it Game Freak deliver and I hope they learn from this game and continue to improve in every aspect 
this be the good pokemon game since third generation can not stop play it 
I have be play Pokémon game since and I have over 60 hour in this current title I have to say it be the most fun I have ever have in a Pokémon game I usually get bore after the credit roll and may play another 10 hour with previous title Brilliant Diamond I have 110 hour play but it be nowhere near as fun as this game the action base catch mechanic be perfect try to sneak up on a Pokémon and catch it and if that fail smack it with a mud ball and try to catch it again Movement with the mount and the freedom of movement in the game be a very welcome addition Graphics could be well and it could be more polished but overall the value of entertainment of Pokémon Legends Arceus be spot on I also enjoy the story and side story in the game I hope this title be the bestselle Pokémon game ever so that we can get more Pokémon title like this or update and addition to this game 
good Pokémon game so far very addicting be play it 4 day straight 
the good Pokémon game I be a fan of the main series I always consider almost perfect the original formula but with this game GameFreak reinvent the franchise with a new combat system a exciting gameplay amazing music and a entertaining campaign the only issue with the game be the Nintendo Switch outdated hardware 
as a person who play all the Pokémon game include the spin off I never enjoy something in this universe like Legends Arceus be addict be well make and kinda impossible for I to stop play its the kinda of game that you play until you fall to sleep really hope that the Pokémon Company keep go with that format and understand that this be the good step they take in all Pokémon franchise 
I haven ' have this much fun on a pokemon game since HeartGold SoulSilver please game freak continue with this system 
I think this be the BEST Pokémon Game be a reinvention the graphic could be well but there be no vas I love the new Pokémon the music be incredible the BEST point be all the posibilitie that you can do capture history pokedex a 10 Enamorus tótem be horrible xd 
the best POKEMON GAME to DATE an amazing game that if indulge in all aspect can lead to countless hour pokemon can ' go back from this great for new and old player alike 
simply the good main series Pokémon game since Black White 2 very addict gameplay major improvement to Pokémon model and animation load of QOL improvement seamless gameplay such a great step forward for the series and something Pokémon fan have be want for year 
great story and control and an amazing world they finally progress it ' still not how it could be but still I hope they use this concept for more game until they find an even well concept 
great game love the interaction with the pokemon in the overworld the developer really work to make they come to life 
one of the good Pokémon game I ’ve play in a long time I ' love to see more Pokémon Legends game that look and play similarly to PLA 
honestly one of the funn game I have ever play definitely not perfect but a step in the right direction for Pokémon an absolute must have 
finally a rework of the old formula to make Pokémon fun and exciting again 
hand down my fav Pokemon game and I have be play since Red Blue the capture battle system make wander the world of Pokemon feel alive can ' wait to complete my Pokedex then get perfect entry and shiny hunting 
love the game it ' a refreshing change for the Pokemon series I haven ' have this much fun with any game in a long time 
as a quick resume I ' say that the game be surprisingly good and refreshing it ' the Pokémon game I ’ve be dream of as a child despite the « hub » aspect of the open world the region be quite huge the Pokemon have a whole new range of animation they ’re really alive now the « action » part of the game be a mix of the Pokémon Let ' go and « normal » franchise I really go for a sneaky hunt of cute monster the hit sound with you catch a Pokémon from behind be insanely addictive I really feel like they GameFreak try their good to provide we a live and refreshing game I love the idea of the village that grow up in time I heavily recommend Pokémon Legends Arceus 
this be easily one of the good Pokemon game since Pokemon Black and White era it ' a breath of fresh air for the Pokemon series and have the ability to be able to roam around to catch new Pokemon experience new little detail that be add to the game the tutorial whilst a little too long for my like still teach you all the rope of the game and once you get over that it ' no long the hand hold game that have be the previous game be able to ignore the main story for hour on end just so you can explore and experience new area Pokemon and witness they with sentience be something else that be amazing the battle system have be rework and it will take a little bit to get use to however once you get the rope of the battle system along with Strong and agile style move lot of great strategy can be bear and once you master the battle system it will be extremely fun to play around with use move that you might 've not before and use strategy that you would have never even think of the dark theme of the game overall with death mauling and have the fear of Pokemon strike into your heart when they attack you in the wild and you must run away and fear for your life as they chase you down it ' a step toward something great Pokemon aren ' just creature that will do a trainer bid they be once wild untamed and it show in this era of Pokemon that they possess a true threat to humankind the graphic be a little off but who play Pokemon for the graphic it ' all about the creature and catch they all which be desperately need in this game to actually complete it Overall Pokemon Legends Arceus be a very fun and addict game the music in the background as you explore be something that can easily be enjoy the gameplay loop be incredibily enjoyable for those that be completionist and want to 100 complete a game it certainly be a step in the right direction for the Pokemon company and this be a great solid baseline for future game 
what a Pokémon game a fantastic step in the right direction for the series in my opinion anyway I ’ve enjoy it so much with a much more enjoyable story then previous game with certain great character and great moment throughout the story as well as a neat connection to other game with familiar ancestor of character which feel good when you spot the connection the gameplay can be consistently fun just stick to whatever you feel like do and definitely don ' play with a guide it ' so much more fun on your own experience and of course the Pokémon be great and there ' a good amount of variety in they and as well shiny hunting be actually possible and not incredibly time consume but still a good challenge and most importantly it ' just fun and sure what Pokémon game before have you be able to be tackle off a mountain by a Gligar 
this be the good new way to play a Pokémon game it ' not for little kid anymore and the content be solid need some more Ui enhancement and more pokémon but all in all a perfect game 
this game be awesome I look forward to Nintendo push a new design for Pokémon and be excited to see the future of Pokémon game base on it 
this be the type of Pokemon game we have be wait for for decade I love the open world and get to see and interact with Pokemon in such a fluid way I love that the Pokedex go beyond Obtain to complete but include much more than just catch one Pokemon and it ' satisfy to complete task and to explore be the game percect definitely not but it be absolutely a step in the right direction and I hope the Pokemon crew take this success and run with it please continue to build improve upon this type of open world game and don ' let it be a one off with a little more artistic polish and in depth story it would be an amazing game 
what you imagine pokemon should be like if you watch the show its an amazing game with so much to catch and it make you really want to catch they all 
love it there ' never a boring moment there ’ ton of stuff to do the act of throw the ball at the Pokémon and the target system be a lot of fun craft the thing you need poke ball potion etc be a great idea for this game 
a fantastic game the future of the franchise never before a Pokémon world have be so alive neither in the mediocre anime adaptation the graphic without doubt can grow exponentially in next chapter and could step from a incredible game to a proper masterpiece a great hope for the future 
legend Arceus be EASILY the most fun I ’ve have with a Pokémon game in a very long time this be the game that make I optimistic for the future of Pokémon 
this be amazing this be one of the good pokimon game 
I haven ' have this much fun on Pokémon since the original ruby sapphire emerald 
I don ' want to write a big review but this be one of my favourite game ever yeah it doesn ' have the good graphic but if ur a pokemon fan u honestly win ' care at all its a 10 10 for I I could play it all day if u just want to play it just to find any flaw then go for it but if you have play it for quite a bit you will know its a sick game and really enjoyable 
the new mechanic be very fun and very welcome after 20 year of the same formula 
this be one of the good Pokémon game I ’ve play in year the story be amazing the new feature be pleasant and the twist at the end where Volo be evil and want the plate to summon Arceus himself come WAY out of left field and I didn ' expect it at all I actually feel BETRAYED when he show his true color the goal of the game be simple catch all the Pokémon and be the first person to complete the first Pokédex in the Hisui region finally the final boss fight against Arceus be so amazing his pattern be difficult to learn and when you beat he you get he add to your pasture and not only that but they FINALLY give Arceus the power of the Legendary Plate which finally allow Arceus to be every TYPE at once 10 10 game I can ' wait for the next generation of Pokémon and what Game Freak and the Pokémon Company will have for we in the future 
I absolutely love this game it ' a fantastic evolution of the series we have be look for it encapsulate most thing that make Pokémon special I call these thing the element of discovery growth and adventure see Pokémon fully realise in space make the experience more seamless while the flow make by the quality of life change make everything so instantaneous it ' absolutely fantastic to see game freak challenge the player and make Pokémon genuinely threaten to both your Pokémon and the player the gameplay loop flow so well it keep myself continue engage a testament to its accessibility and gameplay design this game have its flaw but it ' easy to overlook when I be more excited about Pokémon than I have be in year to see the possibility of where the series could go I would love to see trainer battle and more civilisation realise in future entry particularly with battle it would give further reason to strategise in develop your team especially with grand scale such as on a tall mountain like the battle with red on Pokémon silver and gold 
it be absolutely the most beautiful and involve Pokémon game I have play in a lot of time the change be for good 
really enjoy this game it be quite the unique take on the Pokémon series 
this game be like crack good pokemon game in year so much fun Graphics aren ' the good but it really isn ' bad in handheld mode and the gameplay make up for any shortcoming 
great fresh addition to the series some performance and graphical issue but overall I hope to see more entry with this format 
amazing game it ' like a ninja Isekai Pokémon breath of the wild love child Super addictive and fun 
finally the game we have wait so many year freedom tangible Pokemon much more dynamic battle a story that be not bad at all and many hour of fun which remind I of the illusion of my first Pokemon even so there be still people who believe that a game be only its graphic I invite they to sell their Nintendo Switch and buy another console because they be wrong 
good pokemon game in a long time the be minor issue with the texture and frame rate but still an amazing game 
Best Pokemon experience I would say previous game have be tedious and too easy and easy game mean no fun this game be significantly more challenging and I very enjoy it the pokemon be more vivid and for the first time I have the desire to fill in the Pokedex instead of finish the main story as soon as possible although the graphic be not the good especially in water I would say this game be a great leap and I truly have a blast 
amazing game this be the way gamefreak should follow for the next pokemon game just improve and polish graphic 
game be awesome first 2 3 hour might feel a bit slow but after that it ' really fun also the history be the good of the Pokemon series even well than on my opinion the music be fantastic too and the graphic might feel a bit sharp at the beginning but as you progress on the game it feel much more smooth especially on handheld mode 
pls more just take more time for fix bug and well graphic 
well normally I wouldn ' give this game a 10 10 but an 8 10 but because there be so many morron here which give the game a 0 or 3 10 I will give it a 10 give this game just a 0 or a 3 or even a 5 10 be just objectivly not true even if you dislike the game now where to start with this game I personally absolutly adore it I have over 70 hour right now put into it and I think it be the good Pokemon game since Black White Personally I be never a fan of the 3d Pokemon game until Legends Arceus come out now I want to address the big issue people have first the graphic the graphic be a 2 sided coin in this game if you look at the game in tv mode it look terrible simply terrible the performance in tv mode be also terrible it often feel like a 20 FPS game but if you look at this game in handheld mode it can actually look really pretty in some part if you have the game already just compare a run through Jubilife Village between the tv mode and the handheld mode you will notice that the handheld mode run extremly well and look really good in some area but you will also notice that the tv mode be the opposite of that I would advise anyone to play this game only in handheld mode Personally I can only say that this game be an 8 10 because I only play in handheld mode if I have to judge the game by it ' tv mode it would be a 4 or 5 10 that ' how big the difference be even despite I acknowledge the bad graphic in tv mode I still think a lot of review here be extremly unfair towards the game call Gamefreak lazy or terrible in this case be not true Pokemon Legends Arceus be clearly a passion project for Gamefreak you can see it in a lot of detail they put in the game especially Jubilife Village that be probably the good Pokemon village or town we have since the game go 3d there be so many small detail put into Jubilife Village it be insane for spoiler reason I will not mention any I will just say this game be clearly a passion project for Gamefreak and even with flaw like the terrible tv mode you can clearly see that they try this time with the game I honestly want this to be the main take away from anyone who read this review the game be awesome if you play it as a handheld game but if you play it as a homeconsole game it be mediocre at good I honestly would wish that Gamefreak just disable the tv mode for this game and make it handheld only yes people would still be angry about that but I think we would have way less people complain about the graphic if Gamefreak be just honest with their terrible tv mode it also sadly just show I how the Switch in itself make it hard to judge game like I say I give this game a 10 10 because morron put negative review out which be WAY to negative for such an wellpolishe handheld game on the other hand I can understand those review if they only play in tv mode like I say I would personally give this game an 8 10 as a handheld game but as a homeconsole game it ' in the 3 5 10 area it also show the duality of the Switch itself the console itself be great but there be always set back which drag it down we can clearly see it with other Switch game too for example Breath of the Wild can sometimes have a bad performance if you play it in tv mode but in handheld mode it ' completly fine now I didn ' really talk about gameplay or story or anything like that because I think it be quite clear that I enjoy the gameplay in itself if I would give this game an 8 or 10 10 about the story I really like some of the character they be not great but entertain enough the story in itself be good but not great it more or less be just an excuse to send you run through the world in general this game be extremly gameplay focus and I really don ' want to say anything about that because there be a lot of surprise here it be not comparable to previous Pokemon game that much be clear but in my opinion Gamefreak should continue go in the legend direction if the next Legends game be not on the Switch or on an more powerful switch we might even get a game with a work handheld and tv mode go to add one thing here People who give this game 0 or 3 10 be objectivly wrong even if the graphic be as terrible as everyone say which they be only for tv mode and even than it could be way bad this game be objectivly not a Zero Morrons like that should honestly stop play Pokemon in general why because disencourage Gamefreak now with bad review score be REALLY not the thing we need now I don ' say just blindly applaud they but if people continue to hate on this game we will just get the same old terrible Pokemon formula again 
my good Pokemon game ever great interaction with Pokemon nice game play and decent story and sub quest I hope that Game freak keep this direction to develop a new Pokemon game I really enjoy it 
this be an exciting new leap and formula for Pokemon I have play every game from since red and blue from the the very beginning this game take so much fan base complaint and mold this game into something fresh and exhilarate the graphic be something that can always be improve upon but we be deal with the 5 year old console switch graphical capability there be occasional glitch but they be few far in between and doesn ' affect the playability can this series improve of course but the game be so addict I ’ve spend almost 30 + hour just in the first section explore catch this game be beautiful and make I want to complete everything something the other previous game make boring 
the game be a masterpiece in term of evolve the now previous Pokemon formula the first in chance and Game Freak have nail it in every manner the Game play be immersive fun and addictive fully fledge into an open world format that feel very refined and fresh and can be take as very close to what fan have always want the Soundtrack be one of the good OSTs Pokemon have ever receive the Graphics lack but by no means bad even grand in many place the game nail in every manner put forth and I have be completely blow away by the quality it may very well so be the Pokemon fan ' Dream Game as well as the good Pokemon videogame to date 
the good mainline release of the franchise hand down I couldn ' have ask for more in a Pokemon game since I be a kid this be what I envision the series look like go forward absolutely awesome game thank you Game Freak this be a great base build on it please 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be something to get hype of right from the start when they tease it the massive Openworld make this game really interesting to discover More and MORE with the ability to control the camera angle be great from Sword and Shield ' wild area but in this game we be free to use this feature everywhere as well as the battle and while talk to npc in some case I really enjoy play this game and spending hour and hour in it catching'em all really appriciate their effort in this game I be now look forward to GameFreak ' next project 
I ’ve play every single Pokémon game for the last 25 year Pokémon be my favorite franchise of all time so I ' not one of these troll on the internet who like to shout extra loud about how bad a Pokémon game be when they aren ' actually fan of the series you win ' see I wake up extra early and log online to scream bad opinion to the void about video game that don ' interest I I ' not out here critique first person shooter cause I have no place do so because I don ' enjoy they plain and simple the people online with the extra harsh criticism of this game be exactly that trust I if you be a real Pokémon fan this game be everything I ’ve never have more fun play a Pokémon game ever well I win ' count Gold and Silver that ' pure nostalgia this game have I so excited for the future of the series it ' a glimpse into soooo much potential and it ' just such a pure good time the franchise be notorious for take very small step forward at a time this be a giant leap Game freak have never takin this much of a jump forward and it ' exciting the story be actually interesting and I find myself really take my time as to not rush through it which to be frank I haven ' find myself super enthral by a Pokémon game story in a very long time it ' a breath of fresh air and a fun new way to play the game isn ' focus on the same aspect we be use to so you have to remember that the focus be explore and research not gym badge and elite 4 and it ' very good at what it ' intend for I ’ 60 hour in and still only half way through the main story I have be let myself get lose and immerse in the world there be so much to complete that I know it ’ll easily take a almost 200 hour to do everything go to each new area be always exciting and discover Pokémon in their habitat never get old you ’ll find yourself excited to see a Pokémon you ’ve see a million time in other game they put a lot of time into each Pokémon have their own personality and animation they feel more alive than ever it ' challenge as well if you ’re not prepare before venture out you can find yourself getting attack by a gang of Pokémon and black out real fast we ’ve never be able to experience such a realistic feel to Pokémon in the wild it ' amazing I could go on and on and on honestly just buy it and get excited for what ' hopefully just a glimpse into what ' to come for the Pokémon series 
new fresh bold improvement everything in this be so lovable to I as rpg lover beautiful open world fresh way of battle and evolve pokemon just love it good pokemon game ever live the LORE 
great gameplay and battle mechanic change hope that this be the direction pokemon be go great job Game freak 
be perfect be the game that I want since I play my first pokemon game pokemon ruby 
I should have give it 9 point even if it be not perfect I be still willing to give it an encouraging 1 point it ' very close to the Pokemon world I imagine when I be a child but it ' ten year late unfortunately I can only take time to play this game occasionally at this busy age if it can maintain this level in the future I will like to buy Pokemon game for my child 
the good and most refreshing Pokemon game to release in a very long time so good it make go back to the other pokemon game seem to be a chore which I be fine with could use more content of course but with that say definitely a chance they take but with a huge win 
this game deserve a 10 10 just for the Volo fight alone but it also come with an entire video game 
this be a salute to all seasoned pokemon player that can still be enjoy by new one the story be great not stellar but that be not the centre of this game and sure the graphic could be well but we be essentially play it on a tablet with thumbstick what really shine in this game be gameplay the control and the feeling of catch be so natural that you can do it for 50 hour and still not be bore by it I hope we can expect more legend game in the future as this have be my most enjoy pokemon experience since the original dpp game 
the good an most innovative Pokémon game ever make almost the exact game I be imagine when first start to play Pokémon as a kid a great step for GF to change the old formula for something new 
I be intially sceptical as the recent remake and Sword Shield be bad but after some friend recomendation I give it a shot turn out this be one be the great one this game on itself be just as good as Gold Silver be back in the day initially I ' give it 7 10 but the more I play it the more I like this there ' plenty of content in this one and they be add new quest in update and yes some of the terrain graphic be bad but the game be fun so it doesn ' matter that much 
overall I be thoroughly enjoy Pokémon Legends Arceus I ' about 6 hour in and haven ' want to stop play like any Pokémon game the first hour or so basically the tutorial be a little slow but that ' to allow player of all age to learn the mechanic of the game as other have say visually the game be a little lackluster it look like what I would expect a launch title for the Switch to look like graphic aside the game be a breath of fresh air for the series in my opinion I ' enjoy explore the world learn the mechanic and do everything there be to do in the game I ' definitely take my time with the game and be enjoy every minute of it I ’ve read the review and I think a lot of the 0 rating be troll who watch the trailer and didn ' like the direction the game have take please don ' listen to the troll but also don ' take the perfect 10 score too seriously and think the game be perfect if you ’re a Pokémon fan or a fan of open world game similar to how Monster Hunter Rise work then I think this game be worth take a look at 
this be probably the most unique entry into the Pokemon series since its inception be able to run around the world catch and run away from wild Pokemon be a real treat and really give the series a fresh new spin it can be a little weird at time due to the control not be that fluid and can be very clunky if you be try to switch to a specific item or Pokemon to fight at time but it work very well the battle system be similar but have its own quirk that separate it from previous entry the lack of ability and hold item now give type immunity such as ground be immune to electric and so on more importance as these wild Pokemon can have very high stat for their level especially Alpha Pokemon who can overcome a massive level advantage to deal significant damage to alot of Pokemon I have to unlearn alot of standard Pokemon battle tip that I be not prepare for it ' not bad per say but you might find yourself in a tough spot very quickly if that 20 + level advantage you think would make up the difference for a neutral Pokemon who have a special move that your Pokemon be weak too I ' almost say this game would be a well experience for people not experience with Pokemon but I ' recommend it to basically anyone who might interested the clunky control and the usual poor framerate that come with play on the Switch aren ' too much of a hassle at the end of the day the game be just fun and I really hope they continue to do game like this in the future 
a break from standard tradition Pokemon finally get it ' first truly open world 3d game with plenty of exploration and an emphasis on catch and research Pokemon the only downside be it could use some graphical polish 
as a lover of Pokémon but also someone who have grow tired of the normal game format I wasn ' even too excited when Arceus be go to be release but as usual I get it anyway because I hope it would finally give I the pokemon game I be ask for and I ' so happy to say it really deliver having sink 50 hour into the game so far I be still enjoy it and for the first time since Pokémon Red I actually want to catch em all be this game perfect no but the step that Game Freak have take to bring Pokémon into the current generation of RPG ' be promise but say that there ' still a long way to go 
start off a little slow and the menu be a mess also need a well story but the game play be amazing I love it 
here we have a very good game with the twist of a gameplay we have be wait for World be interesting and progressive with the story but also give you enough freedom to do as you please very recommendable 
the good Pokémon game in at least 10 year it could have well graphic but it be an improvement over the past game 
this game be a solid 9 probably the good pokemon game ever release the graphic be pretty sub par for 2022 but that stop matter 20 minute into the game in my view I haven ' have as much fun play a new release in quite a while 
Don ' believe the super low review score from other that haven ' even play the game while there be issue Legends Arceus be the big leap forward the franchise have see yet result in one of the good game the franchise have to offer 
the game be really fun to play it ' addictive and have a pleasant japanese vibe the introduction be pretty long but it ' not bore I have never be a fan of Pokemon game but I like this one because it ' 3rd person have cute graphic and have an interesting grind with quest but the game have its disadvantage a lot of people complain about graphic to I it ' just fine and doesn ' disturb my eye the most awful thing in the game in my opinion be audio some sound be way too junky or compress 
this game be incredible I have be so addicted to it since I get it I remember as a kid play outside with my friend like we be Pokemon trainer Pokemon Legends Arceus be exactly what I envision play Pokemon should be like they seem to have actually consider the kind of game that people want when they think of play Pokemon Exploring find they in their natural habitat and everything be just quick and fluid the gameplay loop of explore catch rework team be super refined and I ' almost sad that we didn ' get a Pokemon game like this much much early it ' not all perfect though GameFreak simply doesn ' allocate nearly enough budget for their game development as a result this game visually look like it could have be on the Wii there be basically no budget for cinematic and so there ' so much stuff that be express in text that character be do but it just go to a black screen because they didn ' actually animate that you know you ' think a franchise that have one of the most popular and long run tv series to go with it would have the budget to do that not to mention voice acting and orchestrated soundtrack which obviously they have for the tv series but enough of the bad this game be easily not only the pinnacle of the series as a whole but a game that nostalgia put aside deserve the record and accolade it be get 
the most fun I have have play a Pokemon game in a long time the graphic could have use more polish with more detail but overall it isn ' as bad as the outrage over it the way of encounter catch and battling be seamless and intuitive and provide massive positive step forward for the series Future mainline Pokemon game should look at this game as the bare minimum and baseline of what it should be 
Best Pokemon game experience ever the quality of life improvement new combat mechanic the open world area the quest mission base progression reward system and the ability to shift from exploration to combat seamlessly truly make this a breakthrough for the series 
everything say about the graphic be true but if you enjoy pokemon you be go to love this game and spend hundred of hour 
great game I have never be this excited about play Pokemon since I first play it in the third generation in my opinion this new formula should be the future of the franchise I just didn ' give it a 10 because I believe the graphic be a little out of date just a little but that doesn ' affect the player ' experience at all good job GameFreak 
the game be uglyBut be great fun Realy interesting and envolvingIm love itBut be 10 yo graphic 
graphic could be well overall though it ' the good foot forward gamefreak have have in a while great new mechanic and the flow of gameplay be incredible 
this be surprisingly good the new gameplay loop be really enjoyable it feel amazing to be able to explore the pokemon habitat be able to quickly pick between pokemon and send they out whenever you want feel great gather resource be streamlined and doesn ' feel like a chore the fact that battle take place in the overworld and you don ' lose control of your character also feel amazing and it help connect to the world and your team a lot more the story be also more developed and engaging than anything Gamefreak have do in the past some character be a bit too over the top but I guess it wouldn ' be Pokemon without that the presentation be the big drawback the pokemon model look great and they be well animate the VFX be also great so you won ' be disappoint with the way the move look the texture however be absolutely horrible there ' a lot of pop in and there ' this purple shader over everything for no reason the frame rate also dip in the mid twenty from time to time especially during boss battle also no voice act which be a shame Overall this be the big step forward the franchise have ever make by far the most enjoyable Pokemon experience I hope they bring as much of this as possible into generation 9 
I love what Game Freak try with this gameThey need to stop phase out Pokémon as it would add more variety 
Didn ' expect much from just look at the preview of the game I think I would wait for critic to come out I didn ' expect to succeed and yet it do by switch standard get the game one day after release and be addict since then the core gameplay be very fun it ' very effective my only complaint be that it ' a bit strange that you always have to head back to jubilife village before head to another zone also I would love the combat to be perhaps just a bit more interactive not that I dislike the classical turn base stuff but maybe something Paper Mario esque hell even well like the tale series though that could be ask for a bit muchon the graphical side I think people be a bit harsh though I compare this to Shin Megami Tensei the game run at similar performance 30 fps with the occasionnal stuter I do believe smtv look well though not a huge complaint here know the limitation of the switch Game be still charming and doesn ' look too bad music be great enjoy the theme Game progression seem much more fast pace I have never be a huge fan of the whole exp share thing but I think they get it right this time as the game just seem more difficult that other pokemon game alpha pokemon 1 vs 2 3 aggro encounter write this review with over 50 hour in 9 10 for I Hope Game Freak build onto this far the Pokémon Franchise be look to have a great future finally wish they would have focus dev resource on this and delay BDSP by 1 2 year instead 
this game be very fun whether you have play any Pokemon game before this be the most important aspect for a game and it definitely deliver despite its flaw and subpar visual that many be unhappy about 
good game pokemon a pokemon game I have be look forward to since childhood 
this game shouldn ' even be compare to past title this be the most enjoyable experience I ’ve have with a Pokémon game I ' go as far as to say it ' the good in the franchise the 2 battle style make combat more complex and add depth and be a welcome addition the story and gameplay be a breath of fresh air break away from previous title the moment I open the game and see what this world have in store for I I be grin from ear to ear have full control over the camera and have it be a good camera at that make the game feel much well than Sword and Shields half bake wild area this game be phenomenal and be definitely worth a try 
this be game be a love letter to those who enjoy Pokemon and its lore Don ' miss this game if you be a fan of the game even with some comment that I have see about the graphic and all — the game run fine come from Shin Megami Tensei which be a technical masterpiece on its own Pokémon Legends Arceus manage to impress I with the detail it have for its fun mechanic and catch they all base nature one game not to miss 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be without a doubt the bold and most ambitious entry in the history of the franchise set out in the beautiful region of Hisui this game caputre the same open air feel Nintendo be able to achieve with Breath of the Wild with an emphasis on capturing as oppose to battle this game take all of the good concept of let ' go and combine they with their core franchise to create a truly unique experience all it ' own the good element of this bold new venture be it ' absolutely fantastic story while a bit text heavy at time this be the first Pokemon game Gamefreak have make since Black White with a strong focus on story and they without a doubt knock it out of the park with strong character and emotional moment that move I unlike any Pokemon game ever have before in addition to a great story with fantastic character the game be absolutely beautiful and stunning to explore sure the Switch can only push graphic so far and some of the render be far from perfect but in the early hour of play I find myself amazed and constantly think I can ' believe this be a Pokemon game the gameplay loop be insanely addictive too explore capture explore more capture again and before you know it you have lose hour of your life have a blast with charming environment soothe music addictive gameplay and the exciting feeling of encounter a new Pokemon it ' very difficult not to find yourself smile every time you play I could go on about the specific joy of this game like the thrilling boss battle cutscene increase shiny encounter craft the thrill of the hunt wonderful new hisuian form and so much more but I will keep it as brief as possible this game feel like both the true return to Diamond Pearl as well as the next big Pokemon game we have all be wait for I have no doubt this will serve as the foundation for a whole Legends sub series and when I think about this only be the beginning I tremble with excitement to think of what can come next Voice acting 4 k I dare to dream but for now I go back to the wonderful addiction that be Pokemon Legends Arecus it ' not perfect but it ' a beautiful start 
fun game I have not have this much fun play a pokemon game in year love the change they make to it the only thing I m not a fan of be the graphic seem abit plain either than that its a very solid game 
good pokemon experience I have ever have so far it be everything I ve always want and imagine of the Pokemon world one point from perfect for the terrible graphic 
I finally feel Pokémon be back on the right track legend Arceus mix the new feature from game like Pokémon Let ' go Pokémon Sun Moon and Snap to the main rpg gameplay that make the series a success the result a much more entertaining gameplay loop I didn ' expect there ' be as many as 242 Pokémon specie in this game the visual be great too the art style be very charming and I ' pick jagged line over blurry VFX every time I have the chance 
do Pokemon give we a story where the point wasn ' to become the good battler do Pokemon aim to make a game that please all age do Pokemon revamp the battle system to take a different spin and do they incorporate boss fight the answer to all of these question be a resounding yes I wasn ' in love with the game at the start because my expectation be low and the story be straightforward and simple but while this game win ' earn any award it ’ll be a hidden gem that I can confidently recommend to any player who have ever have any interest in Pokemon the game blend Pokemon Snap with a standard Pokemon game add strategic element to catch Pokemon ProsOpportunities for strategywide arsenal of thing to doSmooth gameplayconsthe graphic aren ' just below average it can get in the waylate game get redundantwhen I be play BOTW I couldn ' help but wish it be a Pokemon game I have little interest in sneak up on monster to kill they but the thought of use the environment to catch Pokemon be thrill I have no clue that a game like Legends Arceus would come to fruition or that it ' actually be a lot of fun there ' always something to do — earn money complete sidequest work on the dex catch new Pokemon strengthen your Pokemon collect rare item and shiny hunt it can not be stress enough that you can switch activity at a whim that level 39 cherrim my trainer fight for literally 24 in game hour as I throw every kind of ball in the game at it I get so annoyed I run catch 4 other Pokemon be succession and switch area to earn some money it take a bit for you to unlock every area but you can always return to area you ’ve unlock Strategy wise I have the most fun play this game than any other in a long time when I go to encounter a flock of ursare each one be ten level high than my strong Pokemon so I have to try to lure they out one at a time Problem be lure they out too far lead to interruption from other Pokemon like Luxio Luxray when I finally manage to isolate one they could still wipe my team easily so I have to develop a strategy to consistently defeat they it be an absolute blast and an unexpected challenge fifty hour in and the strategy remain however it do get to the point where you ’re just chucking ball at everything you see to fill the dex it minimize the strategy of the game and eliminate challenge and that impact the fun I love the font but the graphic really need attention it ' not just rough around the edge there ' miss potential and there should be more way to interact with the Pokemon you ’ve catch literally work on the graphic in every department and you ’ve get something really special what make this entry so exciting be the idea that Pokemon might consider evolve from its root to something big and in many people ’ opinion include my own something well definitely a game worth review 
this pokemon game be well then the last like 4 game not include ultra sun and moon as that game post game and improvement make it a well game in my opinion this game be in my opinion really fun for I this game be a 9 but for other I can see it be a 7 to 8 but if you like pokemon or want to get into it or back into it I recommend this game the graphic be bad yeah but be not even that important nor will it take from your experience of this game its really addicting and definately worth play 
the good Pokemon game in year completely tear up the rule surround what a Pokemon game have to be and deliver a fresh more logical take on the series the story actually feel like some effort be put in and the interaction with npc be ACTUALLY enjoyable this universe be so much more engaging as people act like real people confront with these terrifying creature know as Pokemon it actually feel like there ' a point to work on the Pokedex as you educate people around the region on what Pokemon be this Sudowoodo be sad but it ' a plant so maybe spray it with water pulse will help lol the battle system be vastly improve as well popping into a battle be much fast than in or to the point that bet if you play this and then go back to either of those it ' the first thing you notice also ability to move around in battle mean during quick battle you can choose your attack and then start run before the battle even end it ' so much fresher Catching Pokemon be fast too as you can catch they the normal way unless they run which happen a lot or you can sneak around and stealth his they with a ball like the survivalist Pokemon trainer you be the Pokemon GO influence here work great imo it make you feel like Pokemon be actually these wild creature with habitat and temperament finally just a small thing but I like how you can always run from a battle it never make sense that you couldn ' in previous game outside these be the rule of Pokemon game in Arceus you just call you Pokemon back and run tf away which be much more realistic which sort of encapsulate what I like so much about this game thing just make way more sense within the context of Pokemon exist I love it and beg Nintendo to please make more this game be very different from previous game though so that may bother you although if you be one of those people who like to meme about Pokemon make the same game year after year I hope this doesn ' bother you con the art be really pretty but look like * * * * on the big screen so 1 just for basically Nintendo hardware hold back what would undoubtedly be a well game if it be allow to spread its wing 
this be genuinely the most fun I have have play a pokemon game in year I get lose in the wild search for new area and alpha pokemon sidequest and satchel like all pokemon game part of the story itself be pretty predictable but there be aspect I definitely do not see come genuinely love this game so far and glad to see there be still lot to do after the credit roll graphic could use some polishing the cave be pretty yeah but the graphic do not make the game for I personally the gameplay feel smooth and I love the different ride pokemon and craft mechanic overall a very fun game and I hope they continue down this path 
finally something fresh by gamefreak ' standard of course I hope they can really expand on this type of gameplay in gen 9 
bad graphic but very good game lot of new mechanic and change to the formular this be the evolution Pokemon need EDIT I be now finish with the game and I ´ increase the score from an 8 to a 9 because of the really awesome mount Swimming climbing and fly be so much fun 
this be a step to the right direction love this game after burn myself out with Sword Shield I think I be do with Pokemon game after ignore BD SP but this game my god I have so much fun 
Honest Review ok I think this game be go ti be terrible I hold back from buy it but recently buy it after watch gameplay and fan love it I play it and I be very surprised its the pokemon game we all want 10year ago but never too late I guess very addictive game I ve thoroughly enjoy it so much to do could easily sink 100 hour in to it negative for I be the lack of online and the graphic no voice acting and music also I think the battle system need to move from turn base to more of a free move system but regardless of all these fault it have to be one of the good pokemon game since gold silver for I personally its a step in the right direction but have much to improve on honestly a great game and anything I sink 100hours in to be a high rating game 
first of all I don ' remember when be the last time I enjoy a pokemon gsme this much I be a hardcore pokefan this would be a 10 10 game if they mix with the original formula I miss gym battle elite four and even trainer battle I don ' mind that it ' not fully open world that could be really overwhelming with a lot of pokemon and for the last come on Gamfreak put some effort in the graphic the animation be cool the pokemon be cool but the terrain be n64 
the game we want for so long the plot be more mature and the world interesting finally a story I ' interested in Gameplay be fun and make sense in the story you have to complete the pokedex and revive the village for a reason that make sense in the story Grafic be the reason my score be not 10 still be well than what I tought but inferior compare to other switch title a huge step in the right direction for gamefreak I can even forgive they for sell I an incomplete nerfe game with brilliant diamond shiny pearl 
the game would be perfect if it wasn ' for the graphic it ' also really slow to start however past those two point they ’ve completely change the game 
honestly what a game this be complete the dex and everything that last boss fight agaisnt Arceus be incredible and the final trainer battle be intense good pokemon game since gen 5 and it be not the same bore stale formula we have have for the past 20 year game be not empty and be full of pokemon 
haven ' finish it yet but play 26 hour in the first weekend the last time I have do that with a game be probably Kingdom Hearts on the PS2 this game doesn ' always look great but damn it ' fun to play it ' actually fun to catch Pokemon again I ' have a blast Alpha ' be a fun mechanic they actually feel dangerous the game get dark too actually mention death a few time I just hope they make this a series because this be so damn cool have to take a point away for the graphic especially in the water it doesn ' look great but the Pokemon themselves look great so I really don ' mind it you kinda just forget about it 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be an interesting new take in the Pokemon series the game be fun and well pace the cast of character be strong and interesting and the story be satisfactory overall the world feel vibrant but some part tend to feel empty or repetitive 
excellent game just need voice act I coukd bever get into the old pokemon gane because I need a game I can walk around in like this deffinatly reccomemde to anyone who love to play a adventure game with rog element and anyone who love pokemon this be a must buy 
definitely the good Pokemon experience I have ever have literally the only issue I have be * minor spoiler * the ridable Ursaluna Sonic Adventure 2 have well mechanic for treasure hunt I literally only use it for the mission requirement and never touch it again because of how particular the control be for it 
50 hour in around 45 hour of fun the game have terrible graphic you know it everyone know it but also the sound design be lackluster the story be as usual you need 2 functional braincell to understand it but people enjoy Minecraft the game be amazing there be so many QoLs I love you can catch every pokemon without need someone else to trade with you easily the good Pokemon game if you be a fan you need to try it I just wish there be more battling content 
so we finally have a game that Gamefreak have put some effort in however do it actually work minor spoiler if you haven ' watch trailer so be warn so my first sit I sit there for 9 hour straight give this an honest go so I can put together a fair review I play it all on stream and say my pro and con there but here they be in text for other to read and decide on if they want to purchase I have now put in 35 hour I can put together a fair review Overall yes this game be worth and I be very impressed Gamefreak take this risk and I hope future game use this type of system there be some thing they could have do well which I will go into first Pokémon at night could have more of a variety every map have 80 of the same Pokémon at night except a few that be exclusive to that map at night it ' most driffloon you find which be annoying but during the day there ' a variety on each map it ' only at night it ' lack some side quest need some work they need to be more descriptive or give you the map name at least some of they give you a quest where you have to go an area but that name isn ' on any map at all someone would have mention the name but you ' have to remember the map need more little town for immersivness you have people come from other exist place to your town however you never actually find those town instead of have random quest on the map to pick up you could have little town you go pick they up from and then you could learn a little more of how those place operate at the same time except you just hear of all the place and never get to see they which be a shame Pokémon in the wild could have behaviour characteristic get too close to another Pokémon they could argue with each other or even fight have bidoof collect wood to make dam Beatifly landing on tree and suck the nectar just thing to give the Pokémon more life they do go to sleep at night if they don ' despawn and get replace with night Pokémon which do happen now on to why it ' such a great game system the open world style really suit this game and it ' a huge step forwards for the franchise be able to choose to try and catch a Pokémon right away or battle it be great what ' even well be be able to move while battle this doesn ' do anything but it let you look around and if you annoy more than one Pokémon you can end up battle as many enemy that be around you craft now this actually let you do something with the open world style Collect material which you can find on the ground or get as reward for catch faint pokemon you might think it ' a tedious thing but you don ' need to craft you can just smash through the content however craft do add a little more to do for those that like this type of thing collect recipe and craft those new recipe ' to make fight easy in the future Mounts you can run fast break stuff swim or fly and you can switch between they whenever you want with the Pad and if your currently on your run mount and go into water it will automatically switch to your swimming mount Great addition Gamefreak well do however I wish you could actually fly around and fight fly Pokémon in the sky Danger now you can actually faint from Pokémon attack you this could do with be hard though it be very easy to dodge Pokémon attack or get away from they however the fear of you actually faint and loosing item you go out and craft buy be a cool addition to the game Alpha Pokémon be a great addition too you can litterally throw your Pokémon out anywhere and call they back so you catch an alpha Pokémon you can compare it ' size to a regular one you have a choice to either fight the wild Pokémon or catch they right off the bat even aggressive Pokémon can be approach with the correct item I have catch about 10 Alpha Pokémon without battle they the side quest be both great and have their flaw at the same time Most of the side quest have different style quest have a little story too they too but then around 1 5th side quest be just Fill Pokemons Dex entry which be too many in my opinion your planning to finish all Dex entry anyway if you want the reward overall this game be a hard 9 10 I love that Gamefreak go for a risk and put so much effort into a new game rather than we get a new 3ds game that ' slightly big in map size this be a great direction for new Pokémon game I see this as the BoTW of the series this be a test to see if the audience enjoy this style of game and then in future we will get more immersive map map will town we be go to end up have a truly flawless game if they continue in this direction and don ' just use this style of spin off game in the future 
I can say that the game have be really enjoyable so far after 12 hour in game not a game that be as breathtaking as Breath of the Wild but I do think that it could be a steppingstone for the next Pokemon game which might revolutionize its series Game Freak be on the right track I give this a 9 for the fun I have have by the way the graphic be not that bad if you don ' compare it to botw people just have way too high expectation for it like I expect this to be on the botw level what the hell 
the most excited I ’ve ever be to see and catch a Zubat in any Pokémon game the new gameplay loop be very addicting and there ' an actual challenge in catch some of the Pokémon and stay alive the only con I have for this game be the graphic can be buggy at time but I mean what do you expect from an oversized cell phone Bottom line the game be very fun and hold my interest compare to the last 3 mainline Pokémon title 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be an amazing new direction for this series and honestly it ' a thousand time well than Sword and Shield be in my opinion sure I enjoy Sword but Legends be amazing it feel like Pokemon meet Breath of the Wild sort of that or maybe Pokemon meet Monster hunter rise with how you go to multiple massive and open area to explore and hunt thing down in also it ' just so much fun graphic look alright but they be league well than Sword and Shield the gameplay be solid and much more like what I be hope for when I see the original reveal trailer I love this game but it ' kinda tough to avoid getting wreck by high level Alpha pokemon if you wander too far oh and I would say at least make save data for a Pokemon Let ' go game Sword or Shield and Brilliant Diamond or shine Pearl for some free clothing item and two bonus quest involve mythical pokemon in the postgame oh and it ' also fantastic that my favorite starter pokemon Cyndaquil be a starter in this game but I digress just pick up the game for yourself and find out how good it be for yourself 
not a perfect game but man this be by far the good pokemon game release in over ten year 
this be one of the first time a Pokemon game have capture that wonder I feel play my first game when I be young I be astounded at how many risk GameFreak have finally take I genuinly hope that this type of pokemon game get polished more and be a new template for the series move forward however the graphic be in fact pretty awful while usually that doesn ' mean anything to I personally somehow this game make I notice more and the pop in be pretty anoye I don ' really understand how game like breath of the wild can be a launch title and look way more amazing due to clever art style trick to make it run flawlessly on the Switch ' limited hardware but I assume that after this game ' success there will be more effort put into these aspect of the next arceus like game unfortunately the graphic do hold it back a bit but I ' rather have annoying graphic problem and a huge rework of Pokémon than another bland mainline copy paste Pokémon game 
pro this game have some of the most addictive and well design gameplay loop I have play in a Pokémon game the game allow you to be curious and encourage it more often than not and it feel very rewarding for just explore the map it add so many new quality of life update and change like the battle mechanic be expand these change be long overdue for the Pokémon IP and it work really well in the game favor the music be amazing and be so pleasing especially in battle and just wander around the open world the story this time around be surprisingly decent and keep I invest the Pokémon formula be change for the well and it really work in the game favor also the actual Pokémon have an actual personality and it be very refreshing to see con honestly this game be really ugly look at most time and the graphic be just not up to par even for a switch game there be a lot of jank in the control and it take away from the experience the game do have a certain lack of polish that I be sure will be somewhat fix but at release the polish or lack thereof definitely be noticeableconclusion all of the problem I mention be a problem and I wish Game Freak be give perhaps a few more month to iron thing out even though that didn ' happen Pokémon Legends Arceus be one of the most well design and compelling Pokémon game ever and be able to overcome those shortcoming this game be the game Pokémon fan have be wait for year for and for the first time in year I think the future of the franchise be look bright 
I be worried about the graphic and world be lifeless and empty but there be simply too much to do and an addictive gameplay loop to either notice much or care + Pokedex completion be varied and engaging+completionist will be happily busy+Pokemon themselves never look better+music be phenomenal+seamless transition from open world to battles+engaging story graphical artifact be genuinely distract at time flicker pop in and glitche grass flat out ruin some moment 
I will start with the obvious downside the graphic be not good even consider it ' a Switch game it just look unpolished and unfinished the story be nothing special and it ' about what you expect from a Pokemon game however I enjoy play it the change to the stale formula make it a nice and new experience New fighting option no stale trainer fodder fight and it ' fun be a researcher the action sequence give a nice break from the normal more monotone battle I would have give it a 10 if it be more polished and have more content but I ' satisfied for now 
the good pokemon game so far I have not enjoy any pokemon game since 15 year ago but this time I really enjoy it 
the good Pokemon game I have ever play it be all I ever want grow up this game be not perfect but it provide an excellent step stone for future game of this style I hope GameFreak stick with this style of game at time it be painfully obvious this be the devs first time attempt to make a game like this however the gameplay be absolutely addict and the overworld Pokemon be simply too cool to pass up this game 
such an amazing game I hope Pokémon game continue in this direction in the future you can get lose for hour in the world simply just wander around and catch Pokémon it ' the first time I be actually interested in complete the Pokédex Graphics be the only let down in my opinion 
I have never like Pokemon game after the tutorial I would always remove the game because I be bore Technically Pokémon Legend Arceus be my first Pokémon that I have enjoy in my life I have play 20 hour and I ' still a long way from the game it really be an advance to what Pokémon be the graphic leave a lot to be desire but that doesn ' stop the game from be very entertaining if you be someone very focused on graphic do not buy it but if you be a fan of the game or want a change in the Pokémon saga buy and play this game because I promise you win ' be disappoint 
good Pokémon game in a long time cut down on the nauseating text box you have to acknowledge in the previous game 
if you be someone who do or ever have like pokemon you will like this game if you be someone who literally only care about graphic you will not like this game 
not a fan of pokemon until now Game ís amazing Love it all music gameplay every body should enjoy 
the first Pokemon game I have genuinely enjoy and want to finish since HG SS I ' a big fan of Monster Hunter so I wonder if that ' why I love the game so much a sequel dlc with all new Pokemon and some well texture would be this to a 10 
I have be play Pokemon game since gen 1 I have enjoy every Pokemon game since then Pokemon Legends Arceus be a great video game perhaps one of the good on Switch if not the absolute good but it be not the good Pokemon game per say first off graphically it look fine Pokemon game have never be visually impressive and I personally don ' see a whole lot of difference between this game graphically and something like Breath of the Wild the sound be great the music sound track hit hard and the game itself make good use of sound effect sometimes you can kind of tell where a Pokemon might be just by listen it help I a lot as it be much easy to tell when a Pokemon be about to attack Performance be fine the game be 30 FPS but it ' a consistent 30 FPS Personally while I do prefer 60 FPS I don ' actually mind 30 FPS as long as it ' consistent and the framerate here be good enough for I of course though this be a Pokemon game so gameplay be what really matter this game be very fun and very addictive it ' relax to go out look for Pokemon the boss battle need a bit of work but generally I have have fun with this game it ' very addictive I don ' have a whole lot of free time due to work and stuff so the fact that I have play about 50 hour of this game in just the last week that it ' be out say a lot the craft system be a nice idea but it need a bit of work to be really good a lot of the resource you gather be only good for one or two specific item and that seem like a bit of a waste it would be a nice if you have to think about which resource you want to use for which item and if each resource have a few different use as it be you have resource that be very specifically for certain type of pokeball resource that be very specific for certain type of medicine etc it get to a point where you simply just don ' collect certain resource because you simply have no good use for they the Pokemon themselves however be what really matter battle they be fun and switching between the overworld and the battle themselves have never be well I do think the move pool be lack I notice a lot of move seem to have be take out of the game and while in some way that help balance the battle it make it difficult to get the right move for certain Pokemon and type coverage become difficult speaking of variety Pokemon be where this game need a LOT of work the Pokedex be only about 250 Pokemon the small we have ever have outside of remake Most of those Pokemon be from Sinnoh which make sense give the story however it ' a bit disappointing to see such a limited number of Pokemon in this type of enviornment there be about 10 12 Pokemon that seem to be available in every area and with as many Pokemon be there be this simply shouldn ' be the case I know people have complaint about Sword and Shield but this be something they really get right with the wild area in Sword and Shield so it ' disappointing to see how limit the selection of Pokemon be here a 400 500 pokemon size of Pokedex would make a lot more sense here the story be very good it ' not the absolute good story we have ever get in Pokemon but it easily make the top 5 my only real complaint be that there be much too much handholding through the story in other Pokemon game this make sense give how linear the game be in the first place here however it make a lot less sense give the open world enviornment all I really want to do be explore the enviornment and they almost seem to force the story upon you instead I do like the reward for Pokedex completion and completion of the game itself as you go this game give the most insentive to keep go out of all the Pokemon game and easily give the good reward you get money for pokedex completion and I find myself continue to catch as many Pokemon as I can so I can get more money to get more item and clothe I do wish there be more clothing option but the one that be there be good there ' also way more shiny hunting option than usual which be nice for people who enjoy that sort of thing all in all Pokemon Legends Arceus be a very good game but if you be look to pick up your first Pokemon game I ' recommend Sword and Shield first and then check this out afterwards this be easily the well game but Sword and Shield be the well Pokemon experience where you get to see and do more Pokemon relate stuff I ' say both game be 100 percent must play for anyone interested in Pokemon Pokemon Legends Arceus be very good groundwork for future game and I certainly plan on follow to see what they continue to do with the Pokemon Legends series I think with a bit of refinement and just generally take everything a bit far this very well could be the future of main line Pokemon game and that excite I 
it be a little liberation that this game offer we Fluidity of play and freedom of movement be as good as graphic performance be in agony it will be impossible for I to return to an episode that would take up the gameplay and the speed of the old game the scenario be good if we be Role play we be more a researcher than a trainer and it be logical with agoal to complete a pokédex the rating be quite high because I have fun on it and I appreciate the initiative of change it ' a good old whiskey serve in a good old bidet I hope for a legend 2 that would push all of this higher and finally use the processor of this Switch 
Pokemon be back and well then ever the Gameplay be refreshing but the story need some work that ' really my only problem with this game this be solid evidence that Graphics do not measure how good a game be 
really amazing game overall love the new mechanic and it would be amazing to see these implement in mainline Pokémon game if not have the spin off with legend and keep it go it have to be say the graphic aren ' up to par which be a real shame and it could have really do with voice actor I feel like it ' something they need to invest in go forward but more than make up for they with its sheer amazing gameplay overall they do an amazing job 
I ’ve play around 15 hour so far and can honestly say it ' something unique and special Nintendo have do it yet again take critic review with a pinch of salt they highlight the technical aspect far too much for what it be like many great Nintendo game they do come with their performance quirk however this do not at all get in the way of the many hour of fun which can be have on this game thoroughly recommend this game to anyone who have a switch even if your not the big Pokemon fan this game be great fun pack with content and a great step forward for Nintendo and pokemon only thing I ask for be more of this in DLC and future game 
everything that I be expect from this game be deliver and even more be true that it still sin with questionable graphic and performance but the gameplay be so good the model of the monster and the new animation be really amazing and the story be actually really good the last part specially overall an spectacular experience and the good pokemon game since fifth gen Looking foward to see what this bring to the table of the mainline games gen 9 could be something incredible 
the most fun I have with a pokemon game since the first gen instead of just do the quest I m out there grind the pokedex for hour without be bore the game would be a 10 but the graphic be on playstation 2 level some pokemon in the background have like 1 fps and you can see pokemon only if you be right in front of they but this game show gameplay > > > graphic 
a new experience of Pokémon and be amazing I can not let it play exelent work for nintendo 
after 58 hour I finally finish the game fully complete the Pokédex and face the fight Pokemon Legends Arceus have be a wild ride a massive step forward for the series which I hope we see go forward I ’ve play every single Pokemon game since FRLG and grow up with the series and never feel more emboldened by it since then Catching Pokemon have never be easy yet still more in depth battle be fun and close to what the anime portray the world like full of environmental storytelling if you go look for it and character that you ’ll recognise from other game but with little twist along the way by make use of it ' setting Legends Arceus also take some more step forward in term of the behind the scene mechanic that I think would be good to take forward into the future competitively and also make it well for casual player by not punish you too hard if you beat legendarie or rare spawn there ' some occasional pop in and sometimes the model look a bit slow when at a distance but that ' be my only real problem with this game but bar that the gameplay loop be amazing and scarily addictive I ' absolutely recommend Pokemon Legends Arceus to anyone 
the renewal of Pokémon have be make as it need in a 3d movement world it have expect thing and some new unique mechanic such as launch the ball mobility in the combat as a trainer and many more it also combine perfectly the action game with the turn game the graphic be nice for nintendo switch and fit the game the main history could have be long one or two señorial more it copy lot of thing of Dragon Quest Monters Joker 3 which be only release in Japan and advanced Pokémon still one DQ monster in development though Pokémon need to go on this way it ' enjoyable could improve but it ' really a masterpiece on this kind of game 
despite the graphical issue that 90 of 3d pokemon game now have these day don ' kid yourself this game be the most pokemon feel ever and most fun I have have since gen 5 which be the last one I actually bother to buy this game be easily go to take many hour for I to beat because I love take it slowly and fill all task I can before progress the story it ' great for chill and just have a good time plus the music and character design be great this time around definitely give it a try if you just care about graphic go play something on xbox or pc then nobody care 
Pokémon be always amazing but this time game freak really try to innovate and in my opinion it work the only problem with the game be the bad graphic 
what can be say except good job Nintendo This may not be the perfect game for people but it do one nicely do job and be one of the good pokemon game in year listen to the positive and negative review I fully recommend 
I absolutely love this game been play it non stop for the past few day and can say that I ’ve experience enough of the game to give a true heartfelt review legend Arceus as a Pokémon game be incredible it ' a refreshing new take on the tired old Pokémon formula while also streamline many feature originate from the old game as a stand alone game however this game be still good but I can ' sing praise about legend without take about the graphical quality on handheld mode the graphic look perfectly fine and most people probably could get use to it within a matter of minute however dock the graphical issue be make much more apparent with the game look like something from the GameCube or Wii era in short Legends Arceus be a great game and for those still on the fence about it I highly recommend you try it soon or later 
as someone who have have minimal interest in Pokémon game up to this point yeah this be the real deal it ' rough around the edge with somewhat poor graphic and minor graphical glitch but it shine at time too with decent character model and pretty sunset the gameplay itself be compulsive the story pleasingly dark and the soundtrack be well than it have any right to be I ' impressed 
I hadn ' have so much fun with a pokèmon game in such a long time love the game a lot great and fluid gameplay love all the new concept that be include the graphic need a lot of polish I hope future game improve on that but keep and improve this gameplay this be the way to go 
good game I have play since BOTW the final boss be epic and I love it 1 point because the graphic be trash 
not the pretty switch game however as far as Pokémon game go this be by far the good it ' the kick in the a * * the franchise need and I have be glue to it since it ' launch the battle system be a bit janky and I feel need some polish but it be refreshing while I have be explore every bit of real estate I can touch I still feel the open world definitely need a little bit more life to it too much space with not a lot go on you ’re probably read this and wonder why I ' give it a 9 10 even though I ’ve throw nothing but negative out that ' simply because the game be fun I feel like fun hasn ' be part of a Pokémon game in a while I love be chase down by random aggro mon I love the fact that there be an actual story the ability to craft and farm be also a nice touch be able to swap a Pokémon ' move on the fly be a great quality of life feature say what you want about this game but it be a step in the right direction there ' plenty they do wrong but plenty also do right I hope to see this Legends series continue amazing game 
I love it this game be a step in the right direction and any pokemon fan will love it while I think the people complain about graphic generally be be a bit dramatic the game be poorly optimize and do feel like it need some tuning up Pokemon can clip through the environment and certain texture I ' look at you water and shadow cause crazy pixelation of everything around it like horrible pixelation but don ' focus on that the game have heart so much heart it be literally breath of the wild meet pokemon with a little bit of animal crossing craft and Fire emblem ' garach Mach monestary it ' worth your time and money and I sure as hell hope we get another Pokemon Legends game Mew perhaps Celebi 
everybody know that this game look like * * * * but man look at the gameplay it ' amazing it ' really fun great pokemon game 
a breath of fresh air for the franchise and by far the good Switch pokemon game 
easily the most fun I have have play a Pokemon game yet I love explore the world of this game I like almost all of the new form of old Pokemon I think the new Pokemon be really cool honestly for a Pokemon game the story be pretty good and the game play loop while it ' different it ' pretty fun and make catch Pokemon very fun to do the game isn ' really focus on fight and collect gym badge instead you build up the first Pokedex it sound like it ' gruele but it ' easy to make progress than you think and it feel good to reach new rank and go to new area the Ride Pokemon in this game be very fun to use and feel well integrate into the design of the environment speak of the environment it ' really good look the graphic look very polished and honestly be one of the good look Pokemon game this be definitely one of if not my favorite game in the series really my only complaint be that your own Pokemon can ' follow you in the world and sometimes try to get your rank up can feel a little tedious 
awesome game with brand new gameplay improvement and great sound although the graphic be still not good Hope it will monimated for GOTY award of TGA 2022 
I be addicted to this game Pokémon have not be this good since like Gen 3 I fully recommend get this game it be amazing so much fun the new mechanic be great it ' just so much fun 
Game Freak deliver everything show in the trailer and boss battle be most fun they amaze I 4th one be a bit difficult expect graphic everything be good and music be very good it make I forget about the graphic the game isn ' perfect but it ' good or I should say one of the good gam in Pokemon 
the game can be well the graphic be 5 10 ok but new mecanic and the pokedex be awesome this the wey pkmn have to follow 
good game in year the fact it make some purist mad show that this game will affect the whole franchise for year to come and well the experience as a whole 9 10 due to lack of accessibility setting 
yes the game be not perfect the world badly need fill up but I sincerely hope future pkmn game keep this style of game Revamp be sorely need and all I would need to be happy with this game be multiplayer battle and some more interesting content to explore in the world 
I be very jaded when it come to the Pokemon franchise simply because GameFreak feed we with sub par overprice game for the last 5 6 year that also contain design choice that be simply put baffle the continous targeting of a young and young audience make the game feel like shallow not flesh out mash a adventure this be why I have so much trouble accept this but here I be legend Arceus be a very decent game story Right of the bat you have a story that be more akin to gen5 one where people talk about actually die not to mention that you get send down to earth by god himself the stake often seem high throughout the story like at the point when the 3 bandit sister snag Growlithe and you have to rescue it the character themselves be mostly flesh out sometimes like in the case of the male female counterpart of the player they could have do more but all in all the individual character motivation and behavior make sense Dfficulty not too difficult not too easy in my opinion they could habe bump up the difficulty of the game quite a bit more but it be a decent level of difficulty where you can ' just mash a until the credit pop up which make it far more enjoyable especially when you go out of your way to fight high level alpha it become a lot more challenging e I catch a 61 alpha Ninetales when my mon be around level 40 Gameplay this game be hand down the big departure from the usual formula and it do what it do pretty good the new fighting style be different and refresh the fact that you can just run around during fight and even get hit by both the enemy and your own attack be a very nice touch the craft be a fun side activity that give you enough oi an incentive to collect most of the stuff along your way which make for a more coherent experience I love that you can just run into high level area and even fight the mon there it feel extremely threatening to run into that alpha Snorlax at level 42 right at the start of the game graphic yeah they be * * * * the Pokemon themselves look clean if I ' honest the attack animation also look decent and oftentime even straight up amazing like Hyper Beam Hydro Pump or Blizzard but the terrain look like some intern do it in a blender the grass look bad than Mario 64 and the cliff wall look like they even glitch out from time to time yeah graphic be not the most important thing in the world but I would have expect more than PS2 graphic rest the sidequest be fun and diverse yeah at the core they be often similar and some of they be bore as well but the game usually sell they to you like they be not which make they feel less repetitive you even have one where you catch a guarantee shiny which you even get to keep you can put all of your Pokemon out of their ball in Jubilife and they even interact with one another such nuance never make it into the game or they be implement in a lazy way but it just make it feel so much more realistic that way all in all Legends Arceus be a good game and worth the money you will get a very breath of the wild like feel where you oftentime just run around do anything but the main story quest 
graphic be terrible but it ' a wildly fun game in spite of that I love everything about the update catching 
I be look at all of the negative review for this game and all of they be just complain about the graphic or the difficulty the game be definitely more difficult than some of the most recent game but it ' not too difficult when I faint or lose I don ' feel like it ' unfair because it ' mostly my own fault and the graphic be actually a step up compare to Pokémon Sword and Shield although they be a step up they aren ' too great at time sometimes you will see part of hill in the distance randomly load in right in front of you or even sometimes tree or Pokémon on rare occasion overall the graphic I ' give a low 7 10 but every other aspect of the game be phenomenal and a big step up compare to previous entry of the series and be why I ' rate this game a 9 out of 10 this game truly be a great game and be a big step up compare to previous game especially compare this game to Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and shine Pearl and anyone who think that this game be somehow bad or just as bad as the other game be completely wrong this game give amazing change and some small change you may not recognize your first time play through the game you can tell they put a lot of thought and detail into so many different aspect of the game there be some problem as far as the graphic and Nintendo Switch optimization but other than that this game be wonderful and the good time I have have play a Pokémon game in year 
huge step in a great direction can not fault the game at this time I genuinely do not mind the graphic I find they stylise grant the frame rate of far away pokemon be low but I m unsure if this be a issue with the switch hardware be incredibly weak or if its a program issue the game be fun first and foremost as someone who s play every single pokemon game to ever release when they release its a breath of fresh air to come away from a old clunky and boring system yes have ability would of be prefer yes I get the competitive side be weak be frustrating for some people but for other who just want a solid non competitive pokemon game for the first time in many year this satisfys that itch I m excited to see what the pokemon company do next and I hope to god they build on this system and retire the old one 
this game be a huge leap for its franchise and just a fun and good Pokémon game you start with a good and deservedly long tutorial if you be a long die hard fan of the Pokémon franchise you immediately notice the fundamental change that be make you actually get a good introduction into the new movement and the catch system if you be someone that be in some way unbiased and pick up the game because it look interesting it be just as good unlike many Pokémon game before this e Sword Shield this game actually have depth and story that I would let adult enjoy it ' a world in which Pokémon be wild people be afraid of they and don ' even dare to touch they if you do not come prepared or act rashly you can very well lose your life from an NPC ' standpoint it ' not an exaggeration to say that this be the situation people of the Hisui region be face the tutorial doesn ' start with you yet again save the professor from a life and death situation choose your starter and off you go I like it graphically there be a lot of room for improvement texture be somewhat presentable play in handheld mode ease the pain but once you plug it into the dock and hook that thing up to a 4 k tv you just notice the many rather unattractive aspect this game sadly have to offer be already on the visual point the attack animation be crisp and look very good NPC ' finally look more like actual people with more add facial expression less repetitive movement look up Sun and Moon as a bad example and a IMO somewhat well dialogue in general Most character design be creative stick out and be memorable their personality be not nearly as one side as what we be use to in the late game so that even e a group of thief you encounter after a couple hour of gameplay explain that they just steal in order to survive there be just more reasoning behind the task and conversation you be face with the multiplayer if you can even call it that be so minuscule that you would forget there even be such a thing I would say that it actually add to immersion that you be mostly alone in these open world level but I would still gladly take an improvement to the current solution of just pick up other player lose item for a slight reward Trainer battle be very scarce in a way it make sense since there shouldn ' be many trainer around anyway speak logically it doesn ' lack of fighting in general since you do this more than enough with other wild Pokémon but there be a slight lack of the ol tiny bit of competitiveness you would get in defeat the elite four I would like to see more option to choose and challenge certain npc for a battle there actually be a training ground in the village that story wise be maybe use only a couple time by the time I have play there be only one battle on it there be no real fighting interaction you can do to challenge someone the Music be good the sound design have get well I e you actually hear an echo of your pokémon scream when fight in ruin and the engaging gameplay with its new fundamental of stealthily sneak up to Pokémon in order to catch they actual trainer vulnerability and the other already mention thing be just fun and that ' what this game be fun to I it be safe to say that this level of lore depth atmosphere and gameplay and design should be the new standard for this franchise 
if you put aside your feeling on the obvious graphical issue it have the game play loop and mechanic feel legitimately great this be GF ' first go ahead at something this big and the mechanic be nail down now they get to start work on do a modern time line Pokemon game with gym and frontier but with these kind of open world environment and smooth out the graphic I spend hour getting lose and try to discover different area with different Pokemon and different way to encounter and approach they 
the game innovative gameplay loop be really engage and the world building of Pokemon lore be exemplary the game be ugly but still have epic scenery and feel like a huge step forward 
what a refreshing shift for such a beloved franchise can ' wait to see where they take this 
do not let the dumb youtuber fool you this game be amazing and the rough draft for all future pokemon game 
great game very addictive and fun not 10 because graphic can be improve a lot 
the game have a very good concept behind it the core mechanic feel polished and it seem Game Freak really do their homework even though technical limitation of the game couple up with blurry and weird texture I think the game be still very playable I enjoy it a lot 
there be some room for improvement in this game but this game be make progress 
it ' a good start it ' a big change to the pokemon game the system make it very exciting it ' worth play for anyone with a nintendo switch or a pokemon fan 
I just think it ' neat be it perfect no not by a long shot however it ' subjective a very fun game and shouldn ' necessarily be push aside just for its look 
this game be great I really like the world and how it ' be set up in these game and some area genuinely look really nice the gameplay be also quite fun but also streamline in many aspect and navigate through Hisui feel fresh and quite enjoyable sure it have some obvious downside to the game like graphic but it feel more like a lack of proper lighting and lackluster art direction where the artstyle of the world itself and the character kind of clash but if I ' be honest this franchise have need something drastically new for a long time and while this isn ' the most revolutionary thing ever this be exact what the series need this game be probably not for everyone either consider it ' a strictly a single player experience about complete the pokedex which I have never bother to do before in previous game but for some reason I find it addict in this game I think people ought to buy it to encourage Game Freak that yes we need more innovation and care put into future title 
Disclaimer if you care a lot about graphic and not gameplay this isn ' the game for you give the game a 3 just because the graphic be lack be shallow I have be play Pokemon since Diamond and Pearl on the DS and this be the most fun I ’ve have with a Pokemon game since this be mostly due to the well structured gameplay loop there be lot of way you can approach battle and catch Pokemon and this freedom really define the entire game instead of press a button to run away from a battle you can just actually run away you can move during a battle give you any perspective you ' like once you get past the tutorial you be free to explore a large area with lot of danger and excitement besides that every mechanic implement be streamline to perfection the gameplay be a much needed and revolutionary step in the Pokemon franchise the gameplay earn itself a 10 10 a valid point of critique be that the graphic be lack Don ' get I wrong there be some moment where the game look pretty but overall it ' very very mediocre the texture be often compare to the Wii era and let I tell you they ’re not far off furthermore there be the usual pop in of tree and rock which isn ' always noticeable but be very jarring when you do notice it luckily the Pokemon themselves do not pop in as heavily they be usually see from far away at the expense of a low frame rate the pop in have be improve from early title like Pokemon Sword and Shield Overall the graphic leave a lot to be desire though it do add enough to game overall therefore I rate this department a 6 10 I be pleasantly surprise by the sound design in the game though I didn ' expect anything else from the GameFreak veteran go Ichinose the soundscape in Legends Arceus take the immersion to a new level for the series the world of Pokemon have never feel more alive my favorite sound be those of the player movement Rolling sprinting crouch in the grass throw a pokeball I be a massive fan of this amount of detail the soundtrack in the game be subtle and remind one of Zelda Breath of the Wild there be some beautiful rendition in there of old soundtrack of the Sinnoh region one of my favorite be Jubilife Village the game sound earn itself a 10 10 People ask for well animation and they get it there be a lot of new animation for the Pokemon themselves the move the npc and much more GameFreak outdo themselves in this department it ' really the little thing that sell I on the animation Pokemon actually make eye contact the trainer can be see show actual emotion after a heavy battle the player often wipe off some sweat the player can get hit by a Pokemon ' move and you can see the player retreat a Pokemon to their pokeball sure they ’re small thing but it ' never see before in the Pokemon franchise a recur theme in Pokemon Legends Arceus there be some moment where GameFreak could ’ve do more or well say at least something the game still fade to black in cutscene where two character be suppose to interact with each other which just come across as lazy it ' an easy technique to avoid animate something and for real time event that ' acceptable however we be talk about cutscene here GameFreak ' cutscene be outdate and it ' sad they didn ' improve they for this game there be lot of thing to love in the animation department but it ' not perfect therefore the animation be a 9 10 for I to conclude Pokemon Legends Arceus be a game worth your time whether you be new to the franchise or a veteran everything combine this game be a 9 10 
it ' what I imagine Pokemon to be when I be a child play gen3 Emerald FireRed LeafGreen graphic be not good but they have never be a strength of Pokemon game give the limited time to develop this game Game Freak have do a good job 
the good pokemon game I have ever play that game be what pokemon franchise need since the begining of course the graphic be horrible but game freak I think leave the comfort area for the first time 
pokemon legend Arceus be truly an amazing game he have some fantastic mechanic it ' the close we ever get to the dream Pokemon game and definitely a step forward to the franchise obviously it ' not a perfect game the graphic be just awful and there fps be inconsistent but the game be fun in so many way that the flaw be just secondary 
to be honest this isn ' the absolute good game ever however I don ' put it too far away from the good ever it certainly shake up core aspect of what a pokemon game can be but even do so you still feel it be definitely a pokemon game if you like the ability to catch pokemon without fight they like in let ' go pikachu and let ' go eevee you woll love this game I will say good game from pokemon since come over to switch 
First Pokémon Game great gameplay and performance I like the style of the graphic but the draw distance and pop in be bummer 
this be a pretty great game honestly after the cute but shallow let ' go game and the AWFUL Sword Shield game this be very refreshing it have a very addict gameplay loop everything be fast and snappy and besides the first hour the game let you play pretty freely graphical issue aside mostly in dock mode handheld look pretty good I fully recommend buy this if you be an old Pokemon fan that fall out of all with the recent game 
if you growth play pokemon you will like it so much Don ' pay attention on the comment of the hater graphic be not so important here 
the game be not perfect especially in the graphic but if you do look past the graphic it be one of the good Pokémon game and probably the good game this year also stay mad verlisify 
good game good mechanic not very good graphic but you ’ll enjoy it anyway 
this new concept of pokemon be wonderful the Monster Hunter like style broght a new fresh air to pokemon franchise this game have a nice gameplay and a magnific soundtrack I would recomend this game to every pokemo fab 
great game very in depth pokemon experience Reamly make you feel like your the pokemon master just the visual could use some tuning pls fix the water combat and pokeball animation 
the good pokemon Game of history I can ' rate it with a 10 10 because of some graphical issue that be a minor problem but it ' very clear that the game need some update to fix the popping 
con First not enough pokemon battle there be less trainer battle than ever now that you can even avoid wild battle by just throw your ball you get to use your hard craft team less than ever there should be more trainer battle to make up for this need more puzzle need more dungeon multilevel cave temple etc the stone query be good but need more area like that more level ladder dumbe down pokemon move variety no ability PROS the definitive correct next step for pokemon different overworld pkm size seamless battle overworld transition Rider pokemon good job but also consider allow other fly 4 leg 2 leg climb type just strap your straddle on an arcenine or luxray for example side mission be a good step Overworld exploration do very well plenty to do and get lose do 
astounded I like this game Pokemon die for I around black and white 2 but I m just blow away by how much this surprised and impress I 
I have to make an account just to let people know to ignore the negative review those people obviously didn ' play the game and probably want some more Sword and Shield type game 
super fun make I more hopeful for the future of pokemon only wish they would put more time into the game and it could of easily be a 10 10 
in my opinion this game be the good pokemon experience ever create it have addictively fun gameplay and the crazy part be that it seem like it be make to be a test prototype the thing miss be the traditional pokemon trope like gym battle and even random trainer battle if those two thing exist in this game it would definitely be a 10 10 the access to be able to fully evolve your pokemon switch out move set on the fly and an easy to understand EV IV system should be a staple to the series move forward this be a new bar that the franchise will have to beat go forward 
a wonderful new direction for the regular Pokémon game and certainly a welcome one yes graphic could be well but they do not undermine the core gameplay loop I have not have any framerate issue either the difficulty spike sometimes which be unexpected for a current gen Pokémon game the story be accessible for its audience 
Tbh I usually play every Pokémon game no matter what even if it ' meh or ok but this game be something else I haven ' feel something from 3 Pokémon since XD Gale Darkness and Colosseum this game give I those vibe but well even tho the graphic aren ' the good this be what I want when it come to a open world Pokémon game I hope GameFreak know that I want more game in this style with obviously some improvement but this be something else only at 20 hour in and I ' not even half way yet I love catch they all and do the side quest that actually matter such a good game and I ' excited to see what come later 
a new refreshing experience for the franchise and definitely the most fun I have have with Pokemon in year while the technical department be certainly lack in graphic and model optimization that doesn ' take from the first experience of an open map Pokemon world the character lore and story be solid the level design be smart and diverse and the combat system be fast fun and immersive I pray that TPC will take this as the new direction for their game even if it have to be a secondary series of game with more time work and optimization this game could 've easily be a 10 
I personally love the game and the premise but the graphic tend to catch my eye most of the time when play a video game in this game they be not the good the game be beautiful in its own way but only if you be pay attention on what be near you 
not Pokemon Breath of the Wild but a Breath of Fresh Air this series be in need of a shakeup and this be exactly what it need hope Pokemon Legends will continue down this trend of experimental Pokemon game with RPG element because this have be a blast so far my only knock from give it a 10 be the lack of polish in some area but it ' easily overlook Excited for the future of this franchise 
pretty good GameOnly con I see the way you catch Pokémon in the water I m not a man of graphic so I didn ' care about it but I think it could be well 
this be way forward for future Pokemon game no other Pokemon game have give I the sense of wonder and excitement that PLA have this be the close Pokemon have ever come to be a dream game this be the first time I feel like I be fully immerse in a Pokemon world there be so much attention to detail and the Battle Animations have finally got reach respectable quality the game be rough around the edge and have the small lineup of Pokemon move but without a doubt this game should be a benchmark for all future Pokemon main series title 
fantastic game honestly the entirety of the game be probably an 8 5 if only because some mechanic be janky and the graphic could be much well but I ' so happy about the direction Pokemon be go with this so I ' round up instead of down make more like this please 
30 hour in still in main story fun time so far story be about as enjoyable as any other pokemon game Gameplay feel smooth and if you think you can do something it ' probably possible personally I ' not the most picky on graphic since the switch be my only console so it wasn ' really a bother and I find it quite soothe to look at even for extend run I do but yes it be nothing remarkable or groundbreake in that department 
I just can ' give it a 10 10 since the graphic be UGLY at time its not optimize and there ' be more popping in this game than any other I ’ve try with that out of the way and also the rather long tutorial this be a dream come true the gameplay be very well design for you to do whatever you like more investigate complete the Pokédex gather resource train battle go for sub mission or remain attached to the main quest all magnificently incorporate in a gameplay cycle that it ' go to consume you the variety of creature and their animation be superb the story be the good we have today match with Pokémon fan will love it no doubt about it new comer might have a hard time at the beginning but when the grind start guarantee that it will not stop thank Gamefreak 
story wise this have some of the good writing Gamefreak have do since the character be flesh out without the 2000 sun and moon cutscene every second and play very smoothly Gameplay be definitely a hit or miss you will either hate it or love it since there be very few battle and most of the gameplay be just battle this be a solid 9 10 please don ' work on DLC for this Gamefreak and give we some nice graphic patch inside 
fresh new direction for Pokemon a great base for game to come the open world the battle system and the boss battle feel great it certainly lack polish in the graphic department and it be too easy to beat I miss the puzzle and difficulty from other game overall its good that Nintendo be try new thing 
yeah graphic be not amazing but the game be and we finally have a new pokemon direction it ' still a grind game like all the past pokemon game so it will still feel familiar to the past game 
100 a right direction for this game series to go the release of a remastere version of Pearl and Diamond set the stage for this game really well the game itself be honestly addict to say the least and your Pokémon actually feel like you interact with they compare to other game hopefully they stick on this track and make more game like this you will definitely want to try this game for yourself 
very fun game story be very compelling if you like the story in generation 4 game Battling have change a little and it make the experience even more fun very good start for the Legends spinoff series and can not wait to see more game like this from pokemon franchise enjoy every single hour I put into the game 
just an amazing blend of all the recent feature that game freak have previously add plus the open world area feel wicked it be just a refreshing way to play pokemon and an enjoyable game overall 
about 20 hour and still do not finish this game its absolutely perfect new content new mechanic the map be really great despite lack of city only one next generation can be still well do the same 
although there be a few drawback such as graphic issue and main story shortage this game show a satisfiable appearance which Pokemon mainstream game can have afterwards 
the complaint have be make the graphic I don ' need to add to it I disagree about the color palette though I quite like the muted watercolor feel besides that complaint which do not take away from the gameplay at all just the overall experience the game be great Most fun I ’ve have play a Pokémon game since the original I ' serious it feel new and fresh it ' everything I love about Pokémon with new feature and mechanic it ' wonderful 
graphically have quite a few issue there ' no doubt about that there be time be pokemon will spawn and be absolutely jag in movement and its not really fun to look at that being say this be the most fun I have have in a Pokemon game since what Pokemon platinum I be a Pokemon fan I would have fun with most Pokemon game because they be about Pokemon Legends Arceus on the other hand have I enjoy the game because it ' genuinely just a fun experience all round in the game I want to complete the dex I want to catch everything I see I want to play for hour on end without any stoppage it have completely revolutionize the Pokemon series really have be a breath of fresh air I genuinely hope that Game Freak and the Pokemon Company pick up from here and far improve the way Pokemon game be go to be 
well worth the money Best Pokemon gaming experience to date I can not wait to see what else Gamefreak and Nintendo plan to do with the Pokemon franchise as it grow from here 
this be the good Pokémon game out of the entire series and I hope they take all the feature from the old game and merge they into this one I ' not upset that they didn ' have all the old game feature in this one since they be clearly test the water for move the franchise forward I really would like to see mystery trade more than anything and I ' not sure if it ' in the game yet because maybe I haven ' unlock they yet I suppose it ' possible that GF could add feature later on but I ' rather just have they in the next game that have this same gameplay loop and include the feature of old game like hold item tm and hm and ability please for the love of god make a game that have the complete pokédex and fight animation just hire extra people to make the model and animation for christ sake please 
the good Pokémon game that Gamefreak have ever producedwould be a 10 if there be online battle 
amazing game very unexpected if you don ' really care about graphic and you be a Pokémon fan you need to try it 
game mechanic be really good and something really refreshing in comparison to the stale main series it really feel a little like Pokemon Breath of the Wild Gameplay be smooth and engage dynamic at tome character control feel responsive Pokemon variety be somewhat lacking but the sheer number of research requirement to complete each mon differ from know catch and forget the world be not as good look as I hope it to be but good enough to traverse with pleasure Plot be a little meh but hey there be one not limit to catch they all beat team place random word here beat the league this be good enough for I in conclusion despite it ' shortcoming I really really love this game I ' getting bored easly play game and this one after 20 + hour keep I entertained and I can ' wait to play some more 
a welcome change from the series long run formula with a mostly open world explore add non combat catch and main quest side quest journal while there be plenty of room for improvement what be give be a very enjoyable experience grind for exp game loop be replace with research task give you a reason to fight and catch various pokemon with a different set of goal for each pokemon specie this also play into a rank system that replace gym badge 10 hour in and I suspect I will enjoy 30 hour more score base on enjoyment from title as it be and not what I think should have be include or improve 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be a breath of fresh air for the franchise after play 8 generation of game that all feel like the last one the new catch mechanic make catch Pokémon fun again and not some long and annoying prosse to catch the Pokémon you want on your team or if your try to fill the pokedex the more open game make it feel like you a have more freedom the in past game and that ' a huge plus for I even if its not completely open world like BOTW the difficulty in this game be also something to love because not only be battle regular wild Pokémon a bit of a challenge but the new alpha and noble Pokémon can 1 to 2 shoot almost any member of your team if you be not crazy over level also dodge Pokémon in the game be also a challenge I black out 3 time from Pokémon attack I I promise you if you be not pay attention to make sure Pokémon don ' see you and if multiple Pokémon be attack in mass you will have problem I ' 24 hour in and I still haven ' beat the 3 noble boss fight but so far the story be ok it actually feel like a story compare to SWSH but those game be still good to I I could go on all day about everything I love about this game but I still have to say that this game be not perfect the graphic could be a LOT well but they be not God awful like other say and the framerate of pokemon from far away be just bad but nothing bad when in battle or up close to they also wish that we could skip cutscene like in SWSH cuz there be a LOT of dialog so if want to replay this game get ready to mash a through of the talking in the game but even though the game have its problem they don ' out weigh all of the good thing in this game and I hope Game Freak take the base of this game and expand on in it with good graphical feature because this game to I be the good Pokémon game so far 
this be EASILY my favourite pokemon game ever open world be the perfect genre for Pokemon and that ' the way it should be always hopefully game freak keep up the good work 
despite the egregious graphic and empty world the gameplay be amazing and entertain 
great for a Pokémon game much need refresh for the franchise graphic could use a few coat of paint in the environment Pokémon animation be solid and look good ton to collect and the world feel massive not boring if your a Pokémon fan Game Freak really step up there game Pun intend I would like to see all future Pokémon game use this as a template and continue on what be lay here please Game Freak don ' go back to the old format move on use what you build here if your on the fence just give it a shot it ' really fun 
good game by far about pokemon hope one day see pokemon red blue on this style 
nice game with fresh new element the graphic could be well but the game play be lot of fun 
for I this be the second good entry into the Pokemon series although as a disclaimer I have only play each of the mainline game and remake and let ' go if that count as a separate thing Arceus have be my absolute favourite since I play Blue for the first time in the 90 and this new game be beat out by nostalgia and fond memory only to be honest the minimalistic art style be reminiscent of old japanese artwork it ' a beautiful and move take on simplistic world that support the engaging core mechanic it ' true that it ' not as beautiful as some more recent game however for I it be clear that this be not what Arceus set out to be when we talk about open world game the narrative often become about that world and the interaction with that world by the character and story Arceus doesn ' set out to have you move mountain within the world but instead exist as a part of a theorise great whole much like the thesis of the game ' story how do we exist as human within this great world fill with potentially terrify Pokemon who be by default strong than we be the game ask who be we compare to each other and who be we compare to these creature rather than who be we compare to the world for I the beauty be furth than skin deep and the graphical minimalism of the world support this greatly Arceus give a stage to often less use Pokemon it ask you to think about your Pokemon journey far than who be the strong ' and it put the exploration and mystery back in the genre I love it and I sincerely hope they produce more in this vein highly recommend 
this Game I love this Game it ' now my favorite Pokémon game I like the world building and the choose Pokémon for the area they be great and make sense some people don ' like that the Pokémon have fix spot where they can spawn but I like it that way it isn ' so difficult to fill the Pokédex I especially like that you need to do different thing to complete the Pokédex entree it ' refresh new at all the new concept be something what Pokémon really need this be the first important step but hopefully not the last step there be many thing to improve especially the graphic and the distant view but for people who don ' care about graphic only about the game play this be a great game there aren ' very much fight but there be some what I like but this I can totally understand this game play in a time when it isn ' so common that everyone have Pokémon the most fight be easy but sometimes there be hard fight especially in the after story about the Boss Pokémon of the game I like that concept some of they be really easy especially the first but not all two of they be really hard and by one of they I have die two time which don ' sound like much but I play very much dark soul and in this game it be especially important to dodge and the dodge role of PLA be exactly the same as there during the role you be for a short time invincible if you dodge exactly when the enemy be attack Overall I like this game it be great and do very much fun 
great game the wild area can be polished but this game be certainly lead the franchise to a new and exciting direction 
great game a much needed change for the series the good Pokémon game since gold and silver they just need to improve the graphic a bit for the next version of this 
this game be full of really really good idea from the open world with ton of thing to do to the new capture mechanic to the likable character this doesn ' feel like a Pokemon game and that ' a good thing this game be a first step in a well direction for pokemon and I really hope gamefreak build upon these idea and polish the game in future pokemon game 
it ' a beautiful reborn for Pokemon every one can play and love it a beginner or a fan or big fan like I nice story beautiful soundground easy to lran how to play for I it ' a must have for every Switch ' Player 
as a longtime fan I be very happy with this game while it have it ' flaw mostly visual and performance it bring the series back to it ' initial idea and execute they well the gameplay while different be very fun and incentivize use every Pokemon the Pokemon finally have a variety of animation that give they each so much personality I find myself like Pokemon I never think twice about before the catch mechanic be great and while the new battle mechanic be not ideal for competitive they be welcome change to switch thing up if they take this formula add online back into it and fix up some thing it would be the perfect Pokemon game for I 
my favourite Pokémon game ever Legends Arceus feel so refreshing after all the incredibly linear Pokémon game of the past the wild area be a step in the right direction but this be an entire leap some part be still frustrating like necessary 1v3 battle and repetitive star rank farming to progress but even those aren ' that bad I can ' think of anything off the top of my head that be add into this that be a noticeable downgrade from previous game I completely understand why some people might not like this game which be completely fine but I want to make it clear that I ' not praise the game just because so be mostly everyone else I go into this with very little information I didn ' watch trailer or other content about this before it be release I be not very hype for this game before I play it but I very much enjoy the experience the game have be stick in my mind every time I ' unable to play it it always stick in the back of my head wait to get back home to play this have turn into a tradition for I at this point I ' not quite through this game yet and I ' not a very critical person when it come to medium but I still want to add my take on this if you ask I which you shouldn ' this game be definitely worth it especially if you be a Pokémon fan 
the game be very cool my brother get it for I digitally and sure the tutorial be on the lengthy side but with the new mechanic its justify the story be very cool and arceus aka god give you a phone and I like how they have shiny pokemon spawn in the overworld with a sound to go with it they even add something for the black and white fan they add Ingo and even his subway like line and I get a nice smile they even add the subway theme and redo it which be a nice touch this could be legend save the remake 
new gameplay element be amazing good story environment and biome be diverse battle and encounter be slightly more difficult than previous game only major issue be graphic 
I could not bear to play a Pokémon game since the game be just endless tutorial hell with childish storyline that do not challenge I any form whatsoever but this this be finally a dream come true roam through ancient japan with my pokémon battle through somewhat challenging fight and feel like a trainer explorer rather than a kindergardener on a kill spree be just so much fun I love every aspect of it even or exactly because if it ' not fully polished 
such a great jump into 3d gameplay of course it have noticiable problem relate to graphic popping be such a disaster but in term of joy and fun I hope this game set the guideline for the future of Pokémon 
finally they be make a jump out of their normal formula and it work perfectly the only con be the graphic but I really love the game 
for everyone complain about the visual and graphic apparently don ' remember that this game be come at one of the most critically low point for Pokemon Co and Gamefreak if the game be too graphical and have no substance they be tear for laziness in gameplay if the game have ton of content but no graphic they be tear for laziness in graphical fidelity this game ' graphic be enough to make this a highly successful look into what could become another mainline adventure game in the series if you take the core component out of the game the Pokemon this be still a very well uphold adventure game in its own right this game have so many firsts for the series it ' unreal this be the first Pokemon game where I feel like bring the whole concept of Pokemon GOTTA CATCH EM all really be the idea that drive this game forward this be the first game where I feel that Pokemon be actually magical beautiful and dangerous creature never run into the tall grass without a Pokemon to defend you the mantra that be hound at the intro of every single game to this point be actually feel be chase by a lightning CAT would be absolutely terrifying if you be alone this game make you actually feel like you be one of the first people to tame a wild weird and wonderful world fill realistically with Pokemon in short Pokemon never have and never will be the pinnacle of graphical innovation what this game do and show be that you can have a whole lot of fun with be a lean mean Pokeball and food throw machine with enough world and graphic to satisfy the itch for a long time to come 
a massive improvement and fill with quality of life feature that make the game much quick to pick up and enjoy it have graphical glitch nothing too game breaking and while the graphic be rather passable the gameplay and complete push for effort make this game a very enjoyable experience Recommend for the Pokémon fan who felt burn by Sword and Shield 
a refreshing and unique Pokémon game Great mechanic story and for the first time you want to complete the Pokedex have a certain level of complexity and would be great that they add battle with friend Best Pokémon game in my opinion 
love this game so many QoL feature add the more mature tone of the story the tangible danger of the world gather craft very curious what this game mean for the future of the franchise I ' very hopeful though 
Most fun pokemon game I have ever play Gameplay be amazing add a lot of feature for different playstyle which be enjoyable by everyone and give more realistic feel for our creature Story and mission be simple but enjoyable even for adult public graphic should be give more effort in the future but give the style of the art it doesn ' look too bad as one would think having play around 60 hour I highly recommend this 
pro Lots of Pokemon Faster and more fun catch more to do than just battle open world explore be more engaging than in previous title more personalization than other gamesConts Graphics be obviously impact by switch hardware or game be design poorly in term of efficiency they remove ability story be sub par 
this be what long term Pokémon fan have be wait for to I it ' hard to rate the game solely by its performance or quality it ' more about the innovation and the effort and what this will mean for the future of the franchise the game on its own isn ' perfect but I believe it ' everything it need to be 
besides graphic and slow start everything else be great Haven ' play a game without realise 5h go by for a while now love the game loop 
the perfect Pokémon game we know we need with the only downside be its graphic Excellent QoL improvement animation and combat system explore Hisui be one of the good activity ever find in videogame 
very fun and enjoyable game solid game loop my only gripe be the blackscreen when a character do something and we just see a black screen with a sound effect 
addict 9 10 because of poor graphic and missing voice act dialogue be a lil bit childish but this be pokemon game soo I think I will be bore with all that catch stuff nad many task in pokedex but it ' extremely addict the good pokemon game on switch 
just amazing Gamefreak have finally start to modernize the pokemon formula and it ' incredible Haven ' have more fun with a game in a couple of year 
this game be not a 10 maybe not even a 9 but I feel the need to overrate it because all the hate I ' see it ' a great game and most important it ' a great Pokemon game which honestly I haven ' see in a long while it ' definitely worth my time and I ' enjoy every second of it I ' even complete the Pokedex without follow the main story because I don ' want it to end 100 recommend 
good Pokémon I have ever play but why be there still no audio for the cut scene 
what a breath of fresh air for a franchise that feel like it be drown I hope GameFreak go forward with a full head of steam with this new gameplay the story itself be also a lot more competent and enjoyable than Sword Shield ' I really hope Gen 9 be similar to this with more emphasis on graphical fidelity and interact with your Pokémon 
I have be play Pokemon since the gold and silver day even though I have always be a hardcore fan I be slowly lose interest in the series due to the never change nature of the game in the past 20 year and behold Gamefreak finally decide to step into unknown territory I agree the graphic be something that definitely look like they still belong to the previous decade but I feel that they have more than make up for it with the gameplay I hope this set the milestone for all future pokemon game to come 
unique and great approach to an old classic Pokémon there ' a nice balance between fresh and new game mechanic combine with familiar theme great to see that there isn ' an strong emphasis on fighting but more on catch and explore which feel more in tune with the theme of Pokémon a mix between breath of wild monster hunter and Pokémon 
it wouldn ' be a fair review if I just give this game a perfect 10 10 because it do have it ' fault but in all honesty even with those fault this be still a pretty amazing game in its own right and I hope for the future of this series they keep this style of gameplay this be the first game since BW2 where I have actually enjoy play it all the way through despite its issue so that ' why I give it a 9 10 
FINALLY a fun POKÉMON GAME after year of stale game Pokémon finally change their formula and for the well the concept may not sound too interesting at first but build your own team have never be this fun I ' even go as far as say that the game get well and well as you progress zone get big pokémon get smart and you can finally assemble the team with the Pokémon you want I ’ve always want an alakazam in my team and be limit by the outdate trade mechanic but now I can finally use one how refreshing this game would be a 10 10 if it wasn ' for the graphic I be especially disspointe by a certain aquatic zone that look completely hideous and that I rush through to get to the next zone luckily the zone follow be way well look and fun I also don ' like the water mechanic very much I think it ' way less fun to go catch Pokémon in the water than on land the story be ok nothing special but it ' not necessarily bad no voice act also kinda make you cringe along the weird animation during the cutscene some lag here and there but nothing that will alter the gameplay the difficulty of the game be quite easy if sword and shield be a 1 and dark soul be a 10 this would be a 2 or 3 but you can also choose to fight Pokémon that be much strong than your team and try to catch they which add optional difficulty overall amazing game mediocre graphic consider BOTW have a similar style and look mile well despite come out 5 year prior this be a game where gameplay be everything and the rest be pretty much just there to be functional 
great game be really into pokemon during the Gameboy and GB advance but grow out of the franchise until sword and shield which be ok ish but leave I think I be do with these game decide to take a chance on this new one anyways and I ' have a blast and it ' complete rejuvenate my intereste in the series go forward 
Pokémon Legends Arceus be about 8 10 of the way to be a perfect Pokémon game it ' certainly not the most amazing game to look at but the gameplay be fun enough to make up for the lack of graphical fidelity it ' a great addition to the franchise and I hope they continue to build on this concept 
only thing keep it from a 10 be graphic still do not understand how some thing make into final cut Pokemon just go up a tree randomly the outline of your character during some background distance rendering etc however this be the most fun I have have with a pokemon game in year BDSP should ve be this great story and character I do not see how we go bacto tradutional pokemon game after this Gen 9 and BW remake have a high bar to pass I do hope GF get outside help with graphic 
Best Pokemon game ever make Game do a lot of thing well however there be a few small problem the graphic and not enough sex 
PALI_CRITIC 92 100list of my favourite game Pokemon game of all time 
a fun new adventure with Pokemon Worth a play button be easy to remember 
definitely one of my favorite Pokémon game the new battle mechanic be a breath of fresh air and have a sense of similarity to the old battle mechanic the world a big with lot of different Pokémon to find in certain part of the region the visual be lack but the performance on the switch make up for this and the story be great 
honestly I be really skeptical when I see the leak about catch multiple Pokémon to complete Pokédex page but when I actually play the game it be very natural I truly enjoy play this title like I haven ' with the franchise for year this be super fun the graphic be still wonky but in my opinion it doesn ' significantly hinder my experience and it ' even meme able at some point it ' a refreshing game 
the game design be brilliant it ' probably the most fun I ever have play through the game the fast pace batlle and catch mechanic be the thing the hold the idea together if they be slow it would be incredibly boring to complete the pokedex but be quite enjoyable when you can ' catch and battle in a matter of second with no intro or unnecessary dialogue for I the fact that the game be not truly open world be not a negative it would be nice to fly over all the region yes but it do ' seem necessary complete the pokedex be the main goal of the game its great I try to play the game without look for tip and manage to catch every regular mon minus Spiritomb and evolve some of they more on this later the thrill when I find Cleffa Grotle and Munchlax 3 of the last 4 need be one of the good in 30 year of play videogame I think 237 or 242 be a decent number of pokemon to have in the game the max they could have go I believe be 300 More than that would be a slog to get to Arceus the last one I need be Cherubi which I imagine that would be in one of the tree where you can find Cherrim which I find two while go through the first part but I delay because it ' kind bore go back to the village over and over again the one negative thing I have to say about the pokedex arceus mechanic be that be stupid to lock Arceus behind some mechanic that be almost impossible to find on your own I kill the Overkqwil the game give so that ' on I but I would never find that you need to use the same mechanic 20x time the same go do Wyrdeer I ' not sure if you cand find it on the wild but Ursaluna be the bad one I try every item so by discard the one you use on other pokemon I imagine you need the peat block but for I be insane you need to evolve during a full moon which be quite rare it ' insane because 99 of player will need to check guide for it which be bad it ' also impossible to find Manaphy if you don ' have Diamond and Pearl which I don ' but as it be not necessary to get to Arceus it ' ok the Spiritomb mechanic for I it ' ok there be not a particular impossible wisp to find and while do the other stuff I manage to find 93 out of 108 as I have do everything else and be clock 70 hour I decide to check a guide to get to Arceus but if you dedicate time to seach for they while do other stuff as I say it ' not bad the research mechanic be good while it get boring by the end the game make you cycle your team and train almost every pokemon which be a first for I in the franchise usually plan my team ahead and use 6 to 9 max and you can get to a 10 research level really fast with almost all of they the few you don ' it ' actually a nice challenge because they be rare pokemon and you need to make the most of every encounter you have I ' not go through the mass outbreak and distortion but they be a nice change of pace and be very helpful to complete your dex the boss be major win simply battle a high level pokemon it ' ok the Alpha mechanic make some battle really tough but introduce a different approach make the game really fresh for I and the battle be really tough and satisfying after I manage to get through Palkia be a great boss battle and the one traditional trainer vs trainer you get in the end game be really nice I understand that some people may want more trainer battle but it didn ' seem necessary for I but the good new thing be easily the ride mechanic Switching Wyrdeer basculegion and braviary be great it ' a very smooth experience and may very well be the good movement mechanic in video game history not exaggerate be that good the game never feel empty I play almost all the praise triple a open world game and even though there be much more on the screen they usually have more boring part you never need to spend more than 10 second to get from pokemon A to which be great 
the game be a breath of fresh air into the overdone Pokémon formula the new way of complete the Pokédex make the process more interesting compare to catch and forget about the Pokémon the graphic be a down side and need a lot of improvement in my opinion graphic be less important when compare to gameplay the part I don ' like be the overuse of voiceless dialogue the story be interesting compare to previous entry but be over run with boring dialogue Overall the game be an excellent step that Pokémon have need for a long time 
the breath of fresh air this franchise always need can not wait to see more pokemon game use this same formula good job Game Freak 
I ' 35 and the Pokémon series have be a disappointment to I since 2000 I look at gameplay video and decide that it doesn ' look good enough to try my brother say it be a must play Pokémon game because it ' all we ’ve be wait for since 1997 I tell he I would wait and get the next one he actually buy it for I and I haven ' stop play the first day I play I stay up till 4 am I haven ' do that in year this game be legit it ' the real deal Super fun if you ’re in your 30 ' and you use to like Pokémon and you have be disappoint with the series I recommend this game POKÉMON be back baby 
definitely good pokémon game I ’ve play in a loooooong time spend 80 hour + on it to finish the game 
big fan of Pokemon since I be a kid and the game that nintendo make be truly awesome RPG be style and I have to say I be kind of effy on this one but after play it and finish it up its one of many of the good truly everything they do right and I can not wait to reset my character again and so it all over again 9 10 the reason I give it 9 10 be because pokemon gold and silver will always be my favorite 
as of write this I have put over 50 hour into this game finish the main story catch ton of pokemon and do as many side quest I can and I must say I have nit be addict to a game like this since I first play spider man for the ps4 legend arcue be in fact the definitive pokemon experience as of recent the pokemon franchise have become very stale in it ' game with so many half baked game removal of fan favourite mechanic and some barely decent graphic arcue while not the crazy game graphically legend be go to save pokemon from further mediocrity story be fun and quite interesting while not mind blow it will have genuine moment of surprise excitement sadness and fun while some character be quite stale the one of any importance feel very genuine game play be spectacular this be the game gamepley wise be what we have want pokemon to become since we all play our first game catch pokemon in the wild be extremely rewarding battle be fun with agile style and string style be a fun integration and something I wish would become apart of the mainline series as I find it to genuinely change up the fight with get more chance to attack after another exhilarating and your opponent attack multiple time be while enrage you know most time it ' something you could have avoid with the right tactic the graphic be pretty good all round the world be fun and nice however a clash of artistic stylisation and over all world building cause thing to become flat and less than intend the glitch too while I have only experience one I fall that mentioning of glitch be need in this review as some have report man glitch be a common occurrence for they and so all who read this should be cautious of such Legends arceus be the direction pokemon be head while it isn ' the main series of game I m hopeful that aspect of this game go into the main game and I ' excited to see more region in the past my most anticipated be a legend game set in Kalos Galar and Unova would be the most incredible one to play in my opinion if you want this game get it if you ever want to get into pokemon or come back to it buy this game while there be issue to I in no way do these affect the overall grand experience too much other than when I get stuck in the water once lol 
Breathe of fresh air the gameplay be top notch and engage although there should have be a hard mode 60fps would have make the experience way well as well 
it ' just so fun to run around and catch Pokémon and discover different Pokémon in different region the macanic work great and tough the frame rate isn ' always the good if a Pokémon be far away the game look great overall accept in some of the cut scene 
probably one of the most refreshing game GameFreak have do in a long time it ' indulge and the gameplay be absolutely amazing most of the character be very rememberable especially the clan leader a lot of people complain about the graphic but to be honest the only graphic that really look bad be the environment besides that it look amazing the character model be really well do and the Pokemon look very alive 
just Amazing love the lore and new catch system graphic quality doesn ' matter in a game like this and it stay at 30 fps stable 
very addictive game I can ' stop finish the research of Pokémon if you like catch new Pokémon more than battle in the main series you will love this game side mission where simple sometimes that ' the only bad side of the game 
very good game Pokemon Legends Arceus be like a step forwards from Pokemon Sword and Shield you can explore a little more freely and the graphic look slightly well and that step they take seem very successful for they I haven ' finish the game like 14 hour in but it look very promising 
love this game I ' about 8 and a half hour in not go to give any spoiler but the game do get funner and you ’re able to travel more and fast as you play I be really consider trading sell this game after my first two hour the reason for an 8 and not a perfect score be simply due to the unnecessary dialogue in the game which get very annoying as you ’re just try to go out there to explore and catch level up your Pokémon I understand it ' part of the story but they could have limit all the text save I from mash the a button and skim through it I ' not try to sit there for an hour read through what the NPC have to say for a certain quest it would have be well if there be some sort of voice act which would actually bring interest in the story aside from this game be really fun and rewarding just like old Pokémon game love the battling as it add a bit more strategy now with agile strong move Catching Pokémon be also quite fun and provide some sort of achievement in catch the same Pokémon more than once could have be a perfect game it ' still the good Pokémon game release on the Switch 
I ' really conflict on this game it have a lot of negative to it miss Pokémon hold back for DLC meaningless character dull story absolutely abysmal graphic when dock and play on a tv these be all issue that ' kill on the spot 99 of game and yet I absolutely love Pokémon Legends Arceus I ' just unsure as to whether it ' for objective reason or extremely subjective one so yes while all the above negative be true the gameplay loop of real time catch of Pokémon a la the Let ' go series combine with battle and a moderately increase difficulty level improve on element introduce in Sword and Shield make the actual moment to moment experience extremely satisfying as a Pokémon fan this be what I have be wait for since I first play Blue in the 90 but that ' where the subjectivity come in because I think I ' be much more critical if I ' never hear of Pokémon and go into this game fresh Game Freak deserve praise for take chance and move the franchise in an exciting new direction but it really need to be stress just how bad this game actually look I ' all for gameplay over visual but there ' a line in the sand where it just come across as downright lazy from the developer there ' no excuse for the terrible texture that would make a Gamecube title blush one particular scene at a volcano be almost vomit induce in how choppy the texture be this isn ' an indie studio this be a multi million dollar franchise that can and should be do well even with the Switch ' hardware take into consideration other aspect of the game such as the invincibility frame dodge and roll Dark Souls Lite boss battle and the tack on craft system there simply to give more purpose to the open world invert comma much need here as it ' not really an open world as such be so so not offensively bad or fantastically brilliant and represent an opportunity to move the series forward more in the future I miss the gym battle system as well to be honest and hope that make a return in future game flaw aside this be the well fresh Pokémon title since probably Platinum 14 year ago it can be markedly improve honestly I don ' remember the name of a single character and I finish play half an hour ago truly awful but the strength of its gameplay loop be enough to give it a hearty recommendation and definitely enough to get I excited about future game in the franchise 
complete reinvent of the Pokémon formula a much needed breath of fresh air Mechanics be smooth and fun Pokémon feel more alive than ever but graphic be human character animation need work solid 8 10 
for I Pokemon be on a decline the last few entry a decline not because it actually get bad but because after all these year you ' think they could improve these game so much more arceus be almost exactly the big improvement I be always hope for only almost because on a technical standpoint this game be as always rather disappointing I think we all know that gameplay be the most important thing and Arceus do deliver on that front but I can ' lie I often wonder how much well these game could be if they wouldn ' be hold back by Nintendo Hardware 
Pokémon legend ArceusToo Much StoryI love pokemon legend the idea of an open world pokemon game where you explore area hide in tall grass and catch pokemon or battle they real time be more than I could have ever hope for in a pokemon game but let I tell you the story just get in the way ask I what happen I couldn ' tell you painstakingly boring and just in the way essentially you fall from the sky there s a giant rift that you have to close some pokemon be go crazy you got to fix it and of course fill the pokedex and now be talk now be at the good part catch they all Pokemon legend take a little over 24 hour to roll credit however thre be still about 2 to 4 hour post credit of gather all the legendarie for the true ending so don ' think you re do essentially you go into an open area there be pokemon to catch and gather info on by battle this fill up your pokedex and of course make your party strong as you go through the story and ther be incentive to actually seek new pokeomon out and ctache they with your hand craft pokeball that ' right there s a super simple craft mechanic here youl lgather material as you explore and earn they after battle you use these material to craft potion and pokeball unlock new recipe as you fill the pokedex its so addict build your roster up only for the boring story to get in the way I be skip through everything I honestly couldn ' care less what be go on didn ' care to do any side mission nothing make I care about anything other than go out and catch they all and I really wish this be more of the focus just let I go explore at my own pace have crazy hiding spot for rare pokemon that ' what I want not lame biom and check bak in at the villiage but its fine I still have fun despite the game contstantly throw speed bump at I and that ' ultimately my big complaint I feel like I be on a chain the whole time compare to the freedom I feel from a mainline pokemon game and also battle there be rarely any pokemon battle with other in this world which be probably explain in the boring story I didn ' care about but still a let down I m build up a team for what just to catch pokemon but at the end of each story chunk there be a boss battle as well and these be awful you just throw bag of sand at they and dodge their attack super repetitive I would ’ve rather just have a straight up pokebattle Pokemon legend have a lot go against it the lame boss battle the lack of trainer battle and the god awful story drag down the pacing of this game but you well believe I love the moment I be set free to hunt and catch there be secret to uncover the battle system be fun you even keep all of your move your pokemon learn and can switch they out anytime you d like which I love allow you to really play around with move set or prepare for certain battle I would love to see this series take off I give Pokémon Legends Arceusa 7 5 10 
take about an hour or 2 to get into after that its very fun I can not put the game down sometimes probably the good pokemon game ever 
this have get to be the most fun I have have with a Pokemon game in many many year here be some background for anyone who care I get Pokemon Yellow after I play a little of Red my cousin loan I I love it and play though it 3 time I be young and stupid and have erase the game by mistake a few time because I want to experience the beginning of the game I play a little of Silver before my friend want his copy back when Diamond and Pearl come out on the DS I get back in the series after I have take time away from it for a while I enjoy Pearl and have complete the game in a week and play it for a few more then I try play the game that come after I play through Black and have some fun I couldn ' even get myself to finish Black 2 I play and beat over a weekend and didn ' touch it again Sun be boring and I never finish let ' go Pikachu it be fun but couldn ' hold my old man attention I give up on Sword because it be a massive let down and after be someone who start play the series in 2000 I be just kinda do with the repetitiveness of the franchise so when I say it ' the most fun I have have with a Pokemon game in a long time it ' not for lack of try even though I never touch after that weekend I always intend to return to it because I enjoy it at any rate this isn ' a franchise review it ' a review of the new game a game that be have I think about it when I ’ not play it a game that get I to roll out of bed on the eve of my 35th birthday and toss load of hour into it and talk endlessly to my wife about it when I wasn ' play the only reason I win ' rate this game over an 8 be there be still problem with it these problem don ' mean I don ' love the because I do it relax my mind in it ' repetition it also frustrate I with that very repetitive nature the fact that I have spend hour work with one Pokemon and still haven ' complete it ' dex entry highlight a massive shortcoming with the game Most thing need to be repeat 20 to 25 time and that ' a bit excessive in my book as much as I love this game I ' not sure I ’ll ever finish a single Dex entry also the story while good feel like it ' bulk out by character repeat the same few story point over and over to a point that when it happen I just kinda skip the dialogue until something new be be say I don ' need to read where I have come from and what I do 6 hour ago over and over ad nauseam on that the tutorial in this game be horribly long and handholde then we get to the graphic oh boy the graphic I honestly don ' care they look fine for the most part sure there be a bit of clip here and there Water and grass can look a bit outdated but I really really don ' care I often find it beautiful to look at and while I think they could have do well or perhaps hide the graphic behind cell shading like BotW do I ' fine with they I enjoy the game and at the end of the day that be what I ’ look for in a video game enjoyment I have play way too many game with stunning visual and no substance whatsoever I have play game with awesome story but horrible control that force I to stop I just want fun and I find this game very fun even when it’sa bit tedious 
finally we get the Pokemon game we wish for Don ' get I wrong it have it ' flaw but finally Gamefreak listen and try something new and we should at least give they credit for that and let they know that the change and direction of the game be good it be a great foundation of what be to come so what could be well and should be address either for a new game or even DLC the graphic obviously more diverse Pokemon behaviour more rich open world with more interesting viewpoint sort option for the Pokemon box maybe biulde village from the groundup in the wild like Taburasa in Breath of the Wild as kind of a way to tame the wildernessThe gameplayloop just feel very rewarding and it ' so much fun with a little more polish in future game the franchise will reach new height I ' already look forward to a Pokemon Legends Ho oh or something like this definitetly play this game if you have the chance 
Nice Games I really love the new gameplay mechanic the graphic be not really good but its fine 
this game be great I have an amazing time play the game the mechanic keep I entertain through the whole game while it ' not perfect and need some polish in part I still highly recommend this game 
it ' Breath of the Wild meet Pokemon but with a bit of Monster Hunter mix in and I love it this be the close we have be to an open world Pokemon game that I have daydream about since I be a kid Arceus deliver Pokemon Snap level of environmental immersion as a mainline rpg you will encounter pokemon walk swimming fly around in their natural habitat instead of randomly encounter something while blindly walk through tall grass you can summon your own pokemon to gather berry mine shard and engage a wild pokemon all within a few step without wait for flow stop animation and transition it ' truly like play a simulation of the anime issue that I have most bothersome to I might be the fact that you have to fast travel back to the hub city in order to go to the next zone like Monster Hunter it make the world feel a lot small since it ' just a bunch of disconnect environment instead of a huge continent also no mount at the hub city make travel a drag now for my minor issue some of the sound effect be clearly rip from BotW such as the male character sound exactly like Link when he tuck and roll maybe it be mean to be a callback but personally I wish they didn ' recycle asset like that the graphic be also a little rough around the edge here and there some thing like rock and tree disappear if you slightly turn the camera and the game sometimes draw pokemon at its max spawn distance but animate they at like 2 FPS which make they look bizarre against the more smooth and lively world close to you if the hardware be struggle to do this just don ' draw the pokemon that far anyways I ' give this a 8 out of 10 Rough around the edge in part but this be definitely a Pokemon formula I want they to polish and perfect I don ' think I will be able to stomach the old style of pokemon game again if Nintendo can somehow cram in a more modern setting with pokemon center city etc and open world pokemon walk about onto the little Switch cartridge it ' be absolutely perfect it may be possible that the Switch may not have the horsepower to truly get to the next level though 
despite the world not be fully open nothing wrong but botw be fully open with well drawing distance and draw distance be terrible legend arceus be the good pokemon game I have play in a long time since Gen 5 it have ton of content More than we be use to sadly but nothing compare to other RPGS like skyrim and such story be fairly long I didn ' rush and it take I around 50 hour I would like to see the same game but in Jhoto with access to the Kanto region and the full national dex not a modern Jhoto nor ancient Jhoto regular gen 2 Jhoto couple of city multiple town with huge route to catch pokemon still play the game haven ' fully capture all legendarie and I ' at 72 hour but already finish main story and post game story only miss secondary mission the story be meh to decent forgot to talk about that but yeah nothing special compare to a mystery dungeon but its well than some recent pokemon game tho 
as a Pokémon fan in the late 1990 I can honestly say that Pokémon legend Arceus be well worth your time to play and well yes some people might be turn away by the art style of the game that game freak choose to go with I ' not go to judge you for that for I personally the art style look pretty good the Pokémon look great and the world look vast and open but if I have to give it criticism I do have to say that they should ’ve bring over voice act include Pikachu and Eevee ' voice actor but other than that I do really like the game that ' why I ' give it an 8 5 10 Pokémon legend Arceus be everything I want in a Pokémon game and more and yes it do surpass my expectation but it be hold back by no voice act hopefully game freak decide to fix that sometime in the future 
after a couple of year of frustrating choice by gamefreak I can finally say we have get an excellent game in our hand all though the game could have use another year of development it feel to work on it ' graphic and environment that tend to feel empty I can say the gameplay make well up for it 
well I be not a Pokemon fan I go yesterday to my local store to buy Monster Hunter Rise and then when I be pay they tell I if I also want to take Pokemon Acreus that it have release a couple of day back personally never play a Pokemon game before and think to give it a try my first impression be not good to be honest and the reason for knock a couple of point form the score be that the graphic and presentation be bad for a 2022 release game let be honest it feel like a game release in a previous gen Music be also very very generic and just serviceable as well as the sound effect having say that I just keep play and the game have some special charm the control be good the environment be ok but its great to see the little Pokemon just run around and do stuff and you try to capture they or battle they so far I be hook its definitely an enjoyable game and now I want to level and use all the pokemon that I have capture honestly its a good game with terrible graphic but you kind of get use to they I have not even have time to open Monster Hunter rise nor finish Metroid Dread I be sure you will enjoy this game 
while it ' graphic can leave a lot to be desire Pokémon Legends Arceus ' gameplay have be retool for a much more smooth and engage experience move away from the traditional rpg format the game feel more like a modern open world game akin to Breath of the Wild I feel that this game represent a significant leap for Pokémon as a whole draw we close to the Pokémon game that we ’ve always dream of the game be not without its graphical issue however they aren ' significant enough to hamper the gameplay overall I would certainly recommend this game to those look for an open world Pokémon experience thing I like • Open World• Catching and battle Pokémon on the fly• Battles occur in the environment not in arenasthing I Don ' like • unfinished feeling to the graphic with low quality texture and aggressive pop in • Star progression can feel like a grind at time 
it ' Pokémon meet Zelda and I ' love this new style of open world exploration it look great in my opinion play well be very addict it have it ' occasional hick up small bug and glitch but nothing that affect the core gameplay experience 
Game Freak finally try this time this be a major step in the right direction for the franchise after decade of stagnation so far I have put roughly 16 hour into the game and be still love it the novelty of catch and battle Pokemon in an open world setting still feel fresh after all these hour and I can see myself play this game for hundred of hour I have play every single Pokemon game since the original Diamond and Pearl and I can confidently say that this be the good Pokemon game I have play in a long time Game Freak have finally manage to make the Pokemon game we have all want since we be kid the Pros Gameplay be well than ever and fit seemlessly in an open world Gameplay loop be addict and rewarding feel like a more mature game with a high difficulty Maps only get well after the first area Ambience music be beautiful and immersive the Cons Graphics could have be well if the game be give just a few more month AI be well than Sword and Shield but still have a long way to go story be bland start with the negative the game be rough around the edge and if Game Freak ' game weren ' rush they could have take a few more month to polish it and make it look even well this go for the AI too as Pokemon be often just sit around do nothing luckily depend on the Pokemon they will react differerntly to see you some will get aggressive and chase you some will run away from you and some win ' care at all unfortunately even the most aggressive Pokemon be extremely easy to run away from and don ' present much of a threat it be certainly a step up from the lifeless Pokemon AI from Sword and Shield but with a second entry I hope to see Pokemon act uniquely within their own habitat similar to Pokemon Snap Lastly I find myself ignore a lot of the main story as I couldn ' get engage with it and prefer to explore and do side quest instead while the graphic AI and storytelling could use some improvement it ' apparent that Game Freak spend a lot more time on the more important aspect of this game the gameplay Gameplay be king in Legends Arceus and it ' easily the most addicted I have be to a Pokemon game since I be a kid everything be very seemless in the open world set as they finally ditch the time consume and date battle screen and loading screen in between area this game feel like it actually belong on the Switch unlike the awfully outdate Sword and Shield the game loop be very addicting as you go into the open field to collect resource to craft item which will help you on your journey as you catch as many Pokemon as you can to complete your Pokedex most importantly Pokemon have long suffer from the criticism that it ' too easy while this game isn ' hard by any stretch it do feel like the game have mature for old audience quite a bit I have notice Pokemon battle be usually a lot more difficult as the game no long warn you which Pokemon your opponent be send out beforehand and the AI generally seem to be a lot smart when attack you my Pokemon get knock out frequently the first area Obsidian Fieldlands be a bit bland and may not be the good first impression for gamer but fortunately after the first area the map get significantly more interesting the biome change to swampland to coastland to cliffland to snowy mountain all with unique way to traverse they as the game continuously give you new Pokemon to help you get around the music add a key element to what make explore so much fun the ambience music in this game be beautiful and add just that extra bit of immersion when explore especially for player of Diamond and Pearl or even the remake the music be often remixe version of the old soundtrack of Sinnoh and visit old place and see they realize in an open world such as the lake make for a very nostalgic throwback all in all the close Switch game I can compare this to be a mix between Breath of the Wild and Monster Hunter Rise it have the style and presentation of the former with the addicting gameplay mechanic similar to the latter this game be a strong 8 10 and I pray that Game Freak keep this new formula and expand to it it would be very disappointing to see they go back to the old style of game after this 
I love this game it be very different from the original formula but it ' always nice to try new one if they do it right and this one do it ' the first Pokémon game chronologically and the story be very nice I also enjoy the gameplay a lot the formula break from the typical battle after battle and I personally find that really good for this spin off I highly recommend it 
really like the game I vote 8 because the game take too long to let you play it like an open world + texture be ass but I can say this be a really fun game and the animation in combat be insanely good 
I give this at least a 8 the concept be great the openworld aspect be good and gameplay be fresh and unusual for a Pokemon game so show we how the Pokemon line can outgrow from the Gameboy DS era be definitely a positive way to go I would wish for the next generation to become a full grow open world title with a non linear story many side quest but legend Arceus be a good step to that direction but Gamefreak please improve the graphic the Switch system be not that powerful but can do really more when you look at other game like Zelda or even title like the Witcher 3 but still gameplay win so 8 out of 10 
I have be really enjoy the game so far big minus be the graphic they should polish game more to make look more clean and beautiful for that reason I wouldn ' mind later release date overall this game be really take Pokemon game new and fresh direction and I hope next Pokemon game be even well and please gamefreak for your next time hire some voice actor 
Most fun I ’ve have on a Pokemon game since I be a child gen 1 3 yeah the graphic be a little disappointing for a 2022 game but the gameplay be really promising please keep go in this direction gamefreak 
it ' a pretty solid experience it ' not perfect and the gameplay be fun although a bit repetitive at time but the atmosphere be super chill and it can be challenge when you least expect it it ' not for everyone but it actually feel like effort be put into this one in the early game the mon variety be a little shallow but it get much well as you go I ' put it on the same level as Pokemon Emerald it ' not a masterpiece like HeartGold SoulSilver but it have charm and style 
what the franchise need it ' so addictive I can ' stop play and get all Pokémon but the graphic kinda suck for a game make by the rich brand out there good job game freak but update your GRAPHICS I don ' care how many ppl tell you Pokémon be not about the graphic but when your developer be the top money maker you have no excuse 
very fun and I can lose myself explore the area Pokemon Legends Arceus be a refreshing take on the series and I ' excited to see where we go from here 
many long term fan will agree that the last time we get a exceptionally great pokemon experience be when Black 2 and White 2 be release after that while the game be far from bad back then they never quite reach the same height enter 2019 Pokemon Sword and Shield be a desaster they be a rush product devoid of any meaningful content to the point be it feel downright cynical it continue to be a massive commercial success to I it be the point be I give up any hope of ever have another good pokemon experience what I didn ' expect be that Game Freak would then do a complete 180 and deliver this a game definitely flawed but that you can tell they be really passionate about do the graphic suck big time but what this game do provide be a highly addict feedback loop immersive way to catch and interact with pokemon an interactable overworld craft epic optional boss battle ability base progression a well contextualize side quest system a worthwhile story etc if this be the future of the franchise then my gosh my prayer have be hear pokemon be save and I couldn ' be happy tl dr * * * * great 
if you be look for the great Pokémon game ever make Pokémon Legends Arceus be not it while the game be very fun and refreshing like all of the game before it it eventually grow to feel too repetitive and unfun the gameplay loop be to gather resource catch Pokémon complete research task and repeat this gameplay loop for the first 15 hour or so be very fun and addicting but by the end of the game it do not feel as if there be enough variety within the core loop to keep you engage likewise the side quest in the game be pretty typical and unengage which be a huge bummer for those of we who like to complete a game ' extra content the boss battle in the game be super fun while you still battle in these fight you also have to as a trainer dodge enemy attack in an almost bullet hell like way although they aren ' too difficult they add a change of pace to the game ' main loop and reward player for think on their foot Overall Pokémon Legends Arceus be quite a fun game that suffer from a sense of burnout that many Pokémon game before it have make I feel 
this game be very rough around the edge in term of graphic this game do not look very bad to be frank but if you can look past that you ’ll find this to be a really fun game and a definite step in the right direction for Pokémon 
the gameplay be fun and refreshing however the graphic be terrible and the level design be absolutely uninspired even though the game be flawed in so many way the gameplay loop be very addictive and make for the experience I always hope for in a Pokémon game for a first real departure from its standard all of its flaw be acceptable Gameplaywise I hope the new mechanic will get improve on and will be implement in future iteration of the mainline series However Game Freak and Nintendo should also improve on their lazy graphic and level design for their future game because those be a huge disappointment and be unacceptable for any AAA game in 2022 and onward it simply break the immersion 
as someone who ' play Pokemon since gen 1 as a kid I want to see how this new installment stand up to previous one as well as my opinion as a lifelong Pokemon fan the short version be this I enjoy it even with a few criticism I have fun and I actually do catch em all this time the long version be it ' a new and interesting direction for Pokemon to go having do the usual 8 badge + beat evil team for 25 year although the catchphrase imply you have to indeed catch they all it be never the main goal if you do you rarely get anything good unless you be shiny hunting and it be really just for the sake of do it so to make that the goal of get the true final ending of this game be innovative and unique they take away the pressure of the main path to follow and instead put a lot of focus on discover all the Pokemon in the region it also do a good job of make the wild Pokemon feel more dangerous and not just pest now for the downside I didn ' encounter a lot but the thing I do see be the most commonly talk about mainly the graphic I ' not a big whiner about it but it be definitely a bit rough sometimes mostly when high up as when you be on the ground catch or battle Pokemon it ' hard to see however I didn ' find that it ruin my experience of play it there be also some encounter that be frustrating involve chase really fast Pokemon that dash away as soon as you be in their line of sight as well one battle in particular be a huge difficulty spike over any other and be really imbalance in favor of the opponent kid be suppose to be able to play this and it give I a rough time so I can ' imagine how much one might struggle against it also multibattle exist but you still only get to use one Pokemon so you can easily find yourself get wombo combo ' to death with nothing you can do but watch basically it ' definitely a good game at its core but could use some polish if they go this route again in the future I hope they listen to criticism of this one to well balance the next one if you weren ' sure about get this one I will say this if you be a committed Pokemon fan you win ' want to miss it if you be just look to play the hot new game and really want pretty graphic you may want to skip it if you just can ' accept how it look it ' not perfect but it ' good 
it ' a good game be nice to see the story behind the Pokémon mythology famous character and a explication about some event in other game but be not perfect have bug and the graphic sometimes be not so cool 
the most fun pokemon experience I have ever have or I always want the encounter change feel fresh and fun it ' experimental and they get it so right yes this game need polish but it ' definitely not a lazy game you can easily tell that Game Freak put their love into the game but didn ' have enough time to polish it 
start play today and so far so good this be my first pokemon game since red it ' a huge map with hundred of critter different behavior fight or capture this will keep I satisfied for a few hour for sure 
this be the first time since 2006 that I have really enjoy a Pokémon game of course it have its negative point the bad be the graphic and loading error but apart from that the game do a lot of thing right and new and if Pokémon keep go like this it ' on the right track for the future 
if you love pokemon but want a fresh take on the series this will make you happy and give you a lot of meat to chew on the music when it ' there be very nice in my opinion I ' describe a lot of it as mystical or dreamlike the battle theme however seem less varied compare to past title as I can ' recall more than 1 or 2 different theme throughout the main storyline the main story be more or less typical pokemon filler mean it ' the bare minimum you would need to call it a story and exist mostly to get you from point a to some of the character have nice design and there be idea and concept pepper throughout that catch my interest but all in all the story be in itself quite bland and lifeless Unfortunate but not surprising the game do not always look great or even good in term of graphic if you expect something that ' consistently beautiful and polished you will be let down the bulk of my reasoning for an 8 10 review score be the gameplay which depend on what you enjoy do in open world style game will either make or break the game for you the alpha pokemon the new battle catch system and the exploration and gathering craft all scratch an itch for I it feel fluid fun and satisfy to wander around do these thing in tandem while the world itself be on the empty side and leave much to be desire there ' enough out there to keep I want to explore the pokedex research will put off some people who be more into the series for the competitive aspect there be a lot of it and it be require up to a certain point for people like myself who like to relax and wander without worry too much about build a top tier smogon team and plow through the battle tower it ' not go to deter I from enjoy the more lay back aspect of the game Arceus Legends be a very important and positive step forward in the series if they choose to keep go this way and learn from their mistake they could very easily create not only the good pokemon game ever one day but one of the well open world game ever one day they be far from that point with Legends but I have enjoy it immensely as a pokemon fan of more than 20 year 
simultaneously the good and most embarassing thing Gamefreak have ever release a fantastic 10 10 game bundle in a very obviously underdeveloped package the Pokémon model and animation look great but the world itself look like an early progress shoot I would see an indie game dev share on twitter it ' laughable how bad the game look in some area especially most cave and in dark area where the background will literally warp around your character like you be poorly greenscreene in I have many other gripe such as the story pace a lot of dialogue scene either need to be cut short or be more interesting Voice acting would 've help but otherwise the game be honestly fantastic my favourite Pokémon experience to date I just wish it come out like a year later so it would have all the development time it need I would love this style of game to continue and be iterate on it ' a major improvement over the old formula have a game like this with more settlememts to explore and more complex side quest etc would be a dream also thank god that they only release one version 
this be a necessary experiment for the Pokémon franchise and it be execute fairly well most importantly I think it lay a solid foundation for future sequel that will build on the formula the game focus entirely on the single player experience which be where it differ the most from other game in the series so there be no battle other human player and minimal interaction with other and this be entirely by design the game serve as a prequel to the Pokémon franchise so the area you explore be very empty due to they be underdeveloped this definitely give the series a long desire sense of exploration and adventure I ' not a huge fan of Pokémon game I play several of they but skip out on other if I just wasn ' in the mood that formula have not change in 25 year so this a very welcome change of pace while still keep the core spirit of the Pokémon universe the gameplay loop feel much like early Pokémon Go where the main objective be just to explore and catch all of the Pokémon it ' a pleasant game to explore however the gameplay loop do get a little repetitive so I find myself take a lot of break but I would I regularly return to it it have that Breath of the Wild atmosphere which be very relaxing minimal music in the wild only ambient nature noise the music be all very soft piano and vast open space I also appreciate that they add some substance to the story grant it ' nothing to go crazy about but it provide a welcome change of pace to beat all the gym leader and get their badge to become the good that we have be provide for the past 25 year the graphic aren ' as bad as people make they out to be but they definitely aren ' impressive I almost feel like if they weren ' able to do high quality graphic whether it ' cartoon or realistic the game would have look well with some degree of artistic design maybe watercolor impression or anything really because the graphic do damper the sense of exploration a little bit overall it ' a fun game I can see myself take my time to play through because it ' just a relaxing experience everything be solid the effort be exceptional but it lay that groundwork for future sequel which can truly be fantastic game I can definitely tell you this be far more exciting than any possible new generation of Pokémon they could introduce and probably one of the most memorable Pokémon experience in the last 15 year 
I have rock bottom expectation for this game up until the leak if we ’re be honest here if you ever plan on play buy this game do not watch anything Nintendo or Pokémon put out before the release date because the marketing do such a terrible job sell this game but give Game Freak ' track record of the last decade I ' shock they be able to pull this off be a Pokémon fan in the last decade have be rough ORAS be awesome Sun Moon be good too despite repeat playthrough make I sour on they a lot but everything else have be just short of a trainwreck Gen 6 be the definition of lazy repetition aside from bring everything to 3d US UM be the laziest rerelease I think of all time the let ' go game be yet another unnecessary remake of the awful boring Gen 1 we all know how bad Sword Shield be despite their dlc do it a slight bit of justice BDSP finally show a lot of fan how much passion for this series have be lose by fall flat on their face try to remake their good game they ’re more of a remaster than a remake but let ' get into it legend Arceus be a fantastic game it ' the breath of fresh air that we ’ve need for year now I might just have recent bias now but I wouldn ' mind if they didn ' make a main series game for a long time if it mean more game like Legends negative first the elephant in the room since this game get reveal be the god awful graphic I can say they definitely touch it up quite a bit since then but it still just look plain bad like I ' play a PS2 game in 2022 yike immersion break graphic in your billion dollar franchise be inexcusable when this console have give we Breath of the Wild Mario Odyssey learn how to optimize your game already there ' no reason that every previous Switch Pokémon game look well than this one the pop in be so bad too sometimes thing just spawn right behind you or in front of you as you ’re run around it can get annoying when you want to catch a rare Pokémon that ' been give you the slip also the button layout be really weird in legend to the point that almost 40 hour in I ' still hit the wrong button when try to open the map or open the bag to heal my Pokémon why be dodge also make my hand cramp up a lot after long play session please put out a patch where we can change the button layout the braviary fly feature need work too why be there no accent button have to take back off again again after SLOWLY land in these huge open area be so dumb I think the big flaw aside from optimization be the lack of any voice act it be awkward in more recent game but never as awkward as in Legends this game truly need it so many of the big story moment DESERVED more than a text box with that annoying ass boom sound effect but there ' also so much this game do right catch Pokémon complete the Pokédex have never feel well will never feel the same in the slow mainline game ever again after this despite some Pokémon be annoyance to get at least I didn ' have to shell out an extra 60 for a 2nd identical version just for 10 Pokémon they didn ' put in my game lol the new boss battle be incredible too actually fight a Pokémon ON foot I swear I have fever dream about a game like this when I be a kid I feel like the only person who didn ' black out during the story Returnal have condition my reflex to dodge effortlessly I guess the wide open area be all distinct a ton of fun to explore I actually really love the Wild Areas in Sword Shield so know this be what they have up their sleeve bravo just wish they look like a 2022 game the story in true Pokémon fashion be very lowkey up until the end as always but this time I actually feel something I be hurt I be stun at the stake the story establish the whole time I be fill with nostalgia feeling like a kid again impeccable line to walk there that deserve a lot of praise just talk think about it fill I with a childlike joy that have be go for so long with Pokémon it ' even get a fair bit of challenge in the new pretty good battle system who woulda think of course a lot of these positive have small quirk I didn ' jive with 100 of the time but Legends Arceus be an amazing foundation to build sequel off of that will hopefully perfect it ' formula at the end of the day the damage previous game have do to my love trust of Game Freak Pokémon may never go away but this game have do the impossible of give I hope for the franchise again I truly think this be a turning point for the franchise I hope they go full speed ahead never look back 8 5 10 
I be very skeptical about legend arceus lead up to its launch I be nervous that the new formula would be innovative and unique but would ultimately leave a lot to be desire I be actually pleasantly surprised with what gamefreak deliver this be the first pokemon game create in a style that be vastly different from previous title and maintain the pokemon feel while make sweeping change to the overall gameplay loop Pros very fresh take on the formula more action base gameplay sacrifice very little in term of staple game mechanic good pokedex selection a catch mechanic that stoke envy from the let go game varying and noticeable size difference in the pokemon that make each catch that much more unique a serviceable plot much more streamlined competitive building of pokemon that only require a pokemon to be feed certain item decent post game content be able to summon all your pokemon at once in order to chill interact with they interesting option for traversal new pokemon form to play with decent in game economy encourage catch pokemon and collect item and enraged pokemon be huge and fun to capture con not have multiplayer be a shame give how fun the single player content be the level be large but there ' not a whole lot to see in they the appeal of the open world wear off towards the end of the game when all traversal mechanic be unlock the graphic aren ' that great not enough trainer battle in my opinion the new pokemon form be pretty ugly design wise decidueye except for a few arcanine typhlosion and again in my opinion the boss pokemon catch minigame could have be much more fleshed out it just wasn ' that interesting and feel a bit tack on to I but I feel it be a step in the right direction I have load of fun playing arceus and be genuinely thankful that gamefreak not only shake up the formula immensely but manage to get so many thing right on the first try none of the con I list above stop I from enjoy the game from start to finish its far from a perfect experience but it be an experience that get I very excited for future legend title 
the game be not perfect but as a start pokèmon game which try to be more open man do its good work catch and explore without limitation be fun and read about Hisui ' hide lore have be quite fun the problem come when you try to explore for long time and the graphic hold you off a little but it be manegable overall good but GF should really take more time on game 
overall PLA be a great game that bring a lot of innovation a huge understatement and a more lively atmosphere plus it have a good amount of game time for someone to play 25 35 hour and up to 75 to complete everything plus it be overall well polished as I haven ' see any report of major bug or glitch and the Pokémon attack look amazing however it have a lot of downside the new Pokémon design in the game should 've be think out long in general I say this as someone who like around 97 of all Pokémon design the visual be bad obviously but personally I don ' care about this as I would 've play a PS5 game if I do the story be well what you would expect from a kid ' game nothing groundbreaking or offensive my big and arguably my only real complaint be that there isn ' that much gameplay variety you simply just battle and catch a certain amount of Pokémon use move a certain amount of time and do the boss battle attack this be all rather cool but as explain it need a bit more in order to keep I invest also the national dex be small and the multi player be nonexistent this sound like a lot of complain but I be just try to be as clear as possible about the flaw so should you buy it it honestly depend on the person which I know sound like a cop out but this be the truth if you want something that break free from the Pokémon formula no matter what yes buy it if you be one of those people that complain endlessly about Breath of the Wild be Empty Don ' think about it if you be one of those people that be strict and will be annoy about thing not be in the game from before don ' think about it if you be someone who love play around with Pokémon and in the surrounding yes you will love it either way I wouldn ' worry too much whether you make a bad purchase or not as you will still be able to have some fun 
good job Game Freak this game be what Pokémon deserve to be the new formula that work and deliver even with minor gameplay flaw and miss opportunity and with the graphic it have good customization option nice plot really great gameplay loop I haven ' be this invest in a Pokémon game for the gameplay only since solid 8 5 for I 
this be the good Pokemon game since the N64 Stadium title and a huge step forward for this franchise Plenty of room for improvement such as well animation clean visual and more gameplay mechanic with less grind would make the sequel to Legends Arceus a contender for GOTY 
English Pokémon Legends Arceus be the good Pokémon game since Black 2 and White 2 I ' not say it ' a masterpiece but it do a lot of what be ask for this game have the premise of Gotcha they all and it succeed you have to search every corner cross sky and sea everything to have they all be the Pokémon game that we always want from the beginning the game in many moment give you the feeling of total freedom be able to go to almost any corner that be show on the map even if it comply with everything it be not perfect be often mediocre the control be very good they respond perfectly and the vibration give it the touch but the pokemon Braviary have a rough control and be very difficult to control at time the music be quite good when explore I even have to stop to enjoy it in an instant but the music of the fight be the same all the time almost all pokemon game be the same in this regard but when the coach ' music be also repeat without change no more than 2 time it end up tire the story take a long time to start but when it do it end up capture you with the expectation of know what be come but unfortunately it end very suddenly and the game never give room for unknown this as much as I can share I hope it help you when decide whether to buy the game Español Pokémon Legends Arceus es el mejor juego de Pokémon desde Black 2 White 2 no digo que sea una obra maestra pero hace mucho de lo que se pedía Este juego tiene como premisa Gotcha they all lo consigue hay que buscar en todo los rincone cruzar cielo mar todo para tenerlos a todos siendo el juego de Pokémon que siempre quisimos desde un principio El juego en muchos momentos te da la sensación de total libertad pudiendo ir a casi cualquier rincón que se muestra en el mapa Aunque cumple con todo no es perfecto siendo muchas vece mediocre Los controle son muy bueno responden a la perfección la vibración le da el toque Pero el pokemon Braviary tiene un control tosco es muy difícil de controlar en ocasione La música es bastante buena a la hora de explorar incluso tuve que parar para disfrutarla en un instante pero la música de las pelea es la misma todo el tiempo casi todos los juegos de pokemon son iguale en ese sentido pero cuando la música del entrenador es tambien repetido sin cambiar no mas de 2 vece termina cansando La historia tarda mucho en comenzar pero cuando lo hace termina capturándote con la expectativa de saber lo que viene pero lamentablemente termina muy repentinamente el juego nunca da lugar a incógnita Esto es todo lo que puedo compartir espero que te ayude a la hora de decidir si comprar el juego 
the game be awesome not perfect it could be well for sure mainly in the grafic departement but after a 30 minute of tutorial and some dialogue box the gameplay really shinie I have the same felling of lose the notion of time play this game as I have when play breath of the wild and that be a good thing to be achieve 
this be the good Pokemon game I ve ever experience they have defiantly have take some inspiration from Breath of the Wild and have listen to the fan Sword and Shield be a joke after ten minuet of that game I hate it but this be totally different there isn ' enough hour in the day to play this I grow up with Pokemon I watch the series some of the movie play Blue Gold Crystal Ruby and unfortunately Shield those game have something new to they in each iteration Gold have a well progression system there isn ' a huge jump in power level like there be in Blue Ruby be probably the tight Pokemon game I play for a while but when Shield come out I be expect what Arceus be offer here but we get a rehash of what we have be get for the last 20 year this game look like its in early development or its a proof of concept its poor and they need to get some high level talent at Nintendo to bring this to the next level but the pokemon look good and the move look even well it leave I confused how do up some environmental texture could be so hard the lighting be fine but its more a texture issue the environment doesn ' really match the style of the pokemon its odd and you do not really have a sense where you be cause its all kinda samey unless your near a waterfall or a beach or something you can use as some kind of landmark this need improvement but we be close to get that game we always want as for gameplay wise its pretty good I have little issue with the gameplay its still turn base and you share exp but its hard still the pop in and pop out be ridiculous you could be chase down a pokemon and then all of a sudden pop it go away this need fix in the early 00 ' its fine but not anymore the lack of or more the point the absence of voice over be jar still stick in the 90 ' with the text for speech Pokemon be one of the big franchise in the world they have enough for a voice over budget I m give this an EIGHT cause I ' so happy play this it have plenty of issue that it really should be a SIX but the nostalgia be strong with this one 
I love this game this be what I hope for Sword and Shield Grafics be bad but its Pokemon so what I mean they make over 200 Pokemon whit new attack animation I love the exploration could be more detail to explore and fill my pokedex DI think its the right way Pokemon go hope for other game like this one 
as we all know be that pokemon have be at a complete standstill for the past 20 year but now that legend arceus have come out I will admit that I m pleased with the expirence and disapointe at the same time with 20 hour under my belt I have to say that this game be a good game iit not great but its not terrible but its just good I highly reccomend not look at the review because its fill with people give the game 10 but also give the game 2s or 0s so I reccomend just play the game for yourself I promise you will enjoy it 
as an turn base rpg you can do well on the Switch almost the entire look and UI be lift from Breath of the Wild as a Pokémon game it completely blow the other game out of the water the improvement to the core gameplay be so vast it will be extremely hard to replay any of the previous entry unfortunately for Game Freak this amount of innovation be set a high bar thing like voice acting and dialogue tree be go to be a must for sequel you can ' get away with copy paste the entire game any more 
consider Game Freak ' track record recently this be a really fun if a bit janky game 
after almost 20 hour of gameplay I can sincerely say I be enchant by this game and just can ' put it down I play it continuously since I buy it my free time be just fill with it after see what happen with I have really low expectation I be say this be go to flop I be sure of it I be glad that didn ' happen I be not give it a 10 because I feel there be alot of thing they could do with the graphic goddammit it just need a bit of polish maybe some more cool minigame different mystery and wuest that you can randomly find in the wild that would be amazing I feel this formula have an amazing potențial to become almost a perfect rpg anyway I ' glad it be this good and that I buy it maybe we will see DLC to it and even cool pokemon game in the future 
the new mission associate with every pokemón the freedom to explore not just the open area around you but do with the intention to find a specific type of Pokémon distinguish not just by his specie but by other specification and not just that but how you catch that pokemón witch be important to and be a factor that contribute to your research this be very fun you have to be careful not just with the one you be aprouche to but with the environment around you and the other creature that be on it the art style of the menu the one where you select the pokemón you witch to be the first choice on your party to be always at your disposal the new físicas pokedéx with all his mission by pokemón already mention the overal layout and the art choice be very good and create that feeling of be on the medieval era in a very good way the low point be the graphic question and the lack of other city or location with more element but it doesn ' decrease the enchantment that be this game 
almost 20 hour in and love it the battle mechanic be great and the fact that some wild Pokémon be out for your blood as soon as they see you be both hilarious and terrify the only downside for I be the graphic the water especially overall a breath of fresh air for the franchise 
fun game Didn ' blow my mind but it definitely lay the groundwork for a future game that could it doesn ' surpass the experience I have play the gen 1 3 game as a kid but the shake up to the formula be for I just enough for the series to feel fun again for the first time in over a decade the game ' visual seem to be the most common complaint but I don ' really see it Gamefreak have never exactly be master of aesthetic quality and I ' fine with that but it look passable to I sometimes even pleasant roam around the village the first couple hour remind I a bit of the Utawarerumono series the main zone do start to become pretty drab after a while but they didn ' make a poor first impression on I Terrain texture don ' matter to I they could have make they flat color for all I care the mesh LOD pop in be a much big problem the big thing I like about the game the main gameplay loop be fun go out of my way to fill out the pokedex and earn new star never get boring to I as someone who like jrpg but be tired of encounter random or otherwise this new approach to pokemon battle feel nice starting and end battle feel seamless and if a battle isn ' go my way I can quite literally just turn around and walk away Love it the effort level system while it ' not without drawback make the game more challenge the EV system from the mainline pokemon game reward you just for stick with a pokemon long term by effectively give they massive stat modifier in this game my main never feel invincible until I go out of my way to max out their els though it do feel kinda gamey compare to EVs especially the process of level they but it ' just nice to actually be able to see the number now each pokemon have an inventory of move now and you can swap they in and out of the four in use whenever you want I like this a lot well than the way it work in the mainline game there ' an item that let you evolve pokemon you would otherwise need to trade to evolve as a guy who never really care for the trading thing I appreciate this a lot mount be very cool but some more than other all my big problem with this game most of which be quality of life relate you can ' switch between zone without return to the hub area first and you can ' just return to the village at will either you have to get back to a camp first and talk to the scientist guy with his goofy hat first every single time and when you need to go somewhere in the village for something you can ' just leave the second your business be complete you have to walk or fast travel to the gate first this start to get really annoying after the first few hour it would be so much well if they let you jump between zone freely from the map the village be so slow to get around that it ' usually fast to open the map and fast travel to the building across the street than it be to just walk there all the area where you don ' have access to mount feel annoyingly spacious in general the pokebox well this game ' equivalent quickly become an eyesore you have to talk to specific npc to access it and there be no meaningful option to automatically sort or filter it for this game in particular this be a big problem between the ability to seamlessly throw pokeball at wander pokemon without encounter the new pokedex research system and the new effort level system you be encourage to catch every pokemon you lay eye on but as for actually sort through all those pokemon you catch this game make that process no less laborious than it would be in one of the 20 year old Pokemon game that suck a lot there ' no option to skip most cutscene the cinematic moment you be free to skip but the boring conversation you have 5 time each throughout the game you have to slowly click through each line of uninteresting dialogue no option to shorten or disable combat animation the main boss fight for each zone be pretty lame not because the boss themselves be uncool but because the player ' role in the fight be to chuck 100 bean bag at they the mount vary in quality they be more or less this game ' answer to the Bicycle and traversal hm from previous game the deer be pretty great the Surf mount be awesome and for sure a highlight of the game the rest though be just lame I expect the fly one to completely change how I interact with the zone I ' be explore up to that point because it can fly right that should be awesome like an aircraft in a GTA clone that you can pull out of your pocket but no it ' just a glider pretty much I mean glider aren ' so bad but cmon man that be a massive letdown after how cool the fish be 
be graphic good in term of landscape no they be about as basic as it get nowadays not necessarily bad just subpar and I have see the lower framerate that the Pokémon get have when you get a certain distance from they in term of actual gameplay itself though I really enjoy it the core loop of find Pokémon and do different task in order to get more research point be enjoyable you sort of just get lose in the exploring and find Pokémon only to find yourself at one of the corner of the area and you probably still miss a few thing on the way despite the graphic this be a fun casual game to play I could easily see someone play this on a long train ride or car trip which be the sort of game you ' want on a portable system 
this be finally a very solid entry in a franchise that have be stagnate for the last half a decade be very generous after SwSh which be easily my least favorite Pkmn game of all time and BDSP which be to I an extremely pointless retread of an old game with very little in the way of anything new or compelling to offer I be extremely skeptical and pretty convinced this game would end up be a mess but my curiosity end up get the well of I and I really have to say I have be pretty thoroughly win over here ultimately it come to the gameplay actually be quite compelling this time around and it all come down to the fact this game actually require some thought on the part of the player it ' not terribly difficult unforgiving or anything but it isn ' mindlessly easy either you might actually need to think about type match up or what move to teach your Pokemon there might even be a bit of plan resource management and strategy at play here in a Pokemon game Imagine that huh anyway I have no real massive complaint on the game itself its quite fun and not in the mindless check a bunch of thing off a list sort of way even though there definitely be some that here the only big shortcoming here be the visual I have never care much about graphic but I unfortunately have to say the game look awful Gamefreak need more staff in their visual department and that ' all there be to it it isn ' actively detrimental to the game in my opinion but it ' definitely go to both some people more than other so be aware 
I ' 10 hour in and look forward to this game I be quite disappointed in my first few hour of the game minus the opening dialogue which give I goosebump what I see be an under baked game with Pokémon sprite fluctuate in quality depend on where you be stand a complete Zelda BOTW rip off with less charm however once you get past the slow start inconsistent graphic the game start to pick up as your team get strong you be able to do more less likely to get destroy in the wild you can backtrack to see what you have miss previously once you get use to the mechanic know how to navigate around it ' actually pretty fun there be plenty of side quest it ' actually a bit annoying overwhelming because you will see 10 trillion people ask you to do thing in the village after * * * * on the game a bit I do want to say there be some moment in the game that be really beautiful e the theme piano music start as you be undetecte in the grass about to throw a pokeball at a Kadabra lol also the combat be pretty good quite visually appealing although it ' a bit derpy that you can run into the middle of the battle Anyways all thing consider the game have definitely grow on I it can actually be a bit addictiveanyway after my quick review I would say don ' take my opinion for it try it yourself make your own mind up 
it be obvious that the game be not develop enough as one would like but in my opinion it be a very good start for a new vision of the franchise in which we can capture the Pokemon in a more realistic world see the whole surface and also not need loading screen I hope that from now on the next installment seek to use this formula but improve it notably since it obviously limp a lot in the graphic and in the feeling of a live world 
visual and graphic be really bad as always for a pokèmon game and it ' right to blame gamefreak for this the main storyline it ' a bit lame but doable once you get use to the graphic style especially in the first zone and to the Pokémon fly at 3 fps in the distance you will start to get capture by the game and really enjoy the fresh innovation and the new type of gameplay 
one of the good Pokémon since the beginning it ' be a long time since I have fun capture Pokémon and see new one when I ' explore the map graphic wise they could have be well but since it ' a first open world for they I be ok with it hope in the future they continue to make game like this one and they upgrade the graphic 
be play Pokémon since platinum and be through quite a bit of burn out from the last couple of game so how do legend hold up many will ask let ' get the big downside do first the lack of art direction I personally don ' mind low graphic but this whole experience could of be more stylized like mhst2 or a game I pick up recently to play nino kuni which be a pretty old game it come out on the PlayStation 3 and be on switch but hold up because of it ' art direction second issue I ’ve have be mostly the no ability and hold item on the Pokémon help differentiate Pokémon from each other in battle and because I like a few layer of complexity specially in turn base jrpg now we ’re past the bad first can I can say be this be the most fun I ’ve ever have catch Pokémon as the game allow you to engage they in a few different way Stealth be the first option and the method of my choice get in the bonus from throw the ball at their back be very satisfying you can take the Pokémon head on in battle if you want but most Pokémon will run early game so for those who run start the battle back throw your Pokémon at they from behind fun the stun fill out the dex I think be go to be tedious but it ' fun as you get to engage with a few different aspect of the the game you can catch they to level up your research level of say Pokémon give they berry find one of different weight size evolve defeat they battle with they to see they perform move also yes it ’ll count if you use they yourself in battle and stealth catch they can also add to the research level also explore the open zone find Pokémon be great specially when you find a rare encounter you didn ' see the first time go through the area pro tip heavy ball early game be your friend but you got to get close but it ' worth specially for catch alpha Pokémon as they give a seed of mastery you can use to master a move back in town to use heavy or agile style with said move great exp for the team and a good chunk of money finally money which you ’ll need to upgrade your inventory size onto the story and character without any spoiler they be pretty good specially by Pokémon standard as usual Pokémon have very visually striking character and they have great personality too bad there be no voice act which feel like the next step for Pokémon to go with their game as I have a tendency to speed read without voice act and then kinda forget a little what be say after the fact but that ' I but overall I think the story probably be the good I ’ve see out of Pokémon black and white in conclusion I believe this game be great with all the way you can engage with catch and fill your pokédex the technical limitation show very heavily but the Pokémon themselves be full of life and personality with how they be animate hopefully in the future these kind of game be allow more time to bake in oven with a more solid art direction Story and character be great but still voice acting feel like it would do wonderfully in a series like this add to the charming character overall this game be an 8 10 if they continue with this formula for old audience that ’ll be a win 
huge step foreward for pokemon the semi open world be a huge improvement for pokemon but graphic could be well and the lack of trainer battle be the one point I ' critical of the game even think it ' explain by the story therefore only 8 10other Positive + improved fighting systems+ elite pokemon+ craft + no need for trade with real people to get pokemon like gengar+ pokedex system+ + a lot of potential for upcoming gamesnegative graphic outdate for 2022 lack of trainer battle ' 
the game be not perfect by far for I mainly the graphic be the great point of disappointment if only they would have take a little long to polish it out but alas I can look over it however since I think the game be the good and funniest Pokémon game since the Nintendo DS day it ' also the first game in a long time that I can truly play for hour on end day after day hatch a plan to sneak up to a strong Pokémon you don ' really want to fight but still catch and see that plan work out be the good thing ever and even when you fail there be still something to learn from that failure to apply the next time the AI and wild Pokémon also feel strong then other game which for I be a huge plus make you really think about what team you be go to bring when go into the wild TLTR even though not perfect still a very fun game and super refreshing for the Pokémon franchise I ' excited to see what they will do next with this 
I do enjoy this game not as much as I would if it be a traditional pokemon game my only gripe really be the opening it feel like it take foreeeeeever to actually start my journey after have to shovel through dialogue and cutscene the task need to advance they just feel repetitive and the world feel a bit empty my entire time play it I be imagine what it would be like to do battle in a gym or wander through kanto hoenn or johto region with this new engine I hope they think about do such that for the next canon game 
definitely imperfect and glitchy but lot of fun I like that the battle be a bit more difficult this be the direction they should have be take for year 
overall it ' a good game I like the new idea like catch Pokemon without have to enter combat or quickly switch between Pokemon during a battle I also like the open world section and I enjoy play through the story unfortunately the game be limit by the hardware it run on 
this be the game we ’ve all be wait for as day one Pokémon fan back in the day of Red and Blue this be what we imagine the world of Pokémon to be like the open area where you can joyously yeet pokeball at all the mon in the overworld be oh so satisfying to be able to have a linear path with the story but still give you a lot of freedom in term of how you want to build your team and gain experience with all of the research require to complete the first Pokédex be a true blend of what fan have desire while I think this game prove to be the strong game in the franchise gameplay wise I will say the artistic direction could ’ve use a lot more talent to see BOTW on switch as a launch title and look way more robust in term of the environment than Legends say to I that Gamefreak be in dire need of fresh eye to lead they into their next core title as well as a beefed up switch to enhance the overall experience with that being say the game be still look to be a goty contender 
love this Game make an account just to give it a rating just feel like it ' head in the right direction so many good change that make the experience much well and new 
the game be very good the story be not bad there be moment in the game that be very well do but there be other that be not for example there be many bug 
first of all I didn ' finish the game yet but I have an idea of how this game be I be absolutely love this game finally some good attack ' animation a good plot with interesting charachter and lore but I think that the good part be the actual open world even if the graphic could 've be well the ambient be just fantastic I love the pokedex mechanic and I think that be the real fun core of the game however I also find some strange thing that make I a little confused as I have already say the graphic be not that good but this be not a big deal for I there be too many useless praise to the main charachter that sometimes feel a little bit cringe the game tend to be a little bit repetitive in some mechanic like finish a boss then obtain a new level then defeat another boss ect ect 
this game be one of the most important entry that the Pokémon company have ever do thankfully this game deliver an experience that many Pokémon fan have be wait for year however there be small flaw or annoyance that keep it from be the ultimate experience for a Pokémon man let ' start out with some flaw the game doesn ' look at its good even for Nintendo Switch standard everything seem to just be a lack of polish or detail but that doesn ' mean that the graphic be always bad just to the point where it start to get distract and stick out the fix camera when first enter a battle or talk to an npc can either clip through or be completely obstruct by an object thankfully in Pokémon battle you can move around the battlefield one more thing be that through the three noble Pokémon battle that I have complete which serve as the boss battle of the game they all feel like dodge and throw with no real gameplay depth outside of it you can send out Pokémon when the noble Pokémon be stunned but you can completely ignore this message and keep on throw balm and win without send out a single Pokémon that ' it on the flaw I might edit this review if I encounter more problem or good thing about the game now for the good thing first of this be a complete shift from the traditional Pokémon formula there be no gym battle elite four or any league to become champion of your job be to research Pokémon and create the region ' first Pokédex I feel this gameplay can make or break some people interest to buy this game but I encourage Pokémon fan to give this a try for themselves to see if this be the style of gameplay they enjoy to play the gameplay be about catch and research Pokémon in which the objective can vary between defeat the Pokémon with certain move feed it berry see it use move or just straight up catch it Alpha Pokémon can also appear around the map and will always be ten of level above your party Pokémon can also deal damage to you the player cause you to faint and lose some item if you take too much damage I love the animation of the Pokémon because they be able to focus on a small pool of Pokémon and actually deliver on that promise let ' not talk about SWSH Pokémon battle have also increase the freedom of the player now after a battle start you be freely able to move around the battlefield and look around with different viewing angle a new mechanic be add with agile and strong style of move agile move decrease the power of the move and give your Pokémon more likely chance of get their next move soon strong style be the opposite increase power and less likely chance of get the next move soon this do give an extra layer of strategy and also scrap the idea of alternate move you can and will get two turn in succession or take two move from an opponent in a row side quest can be lackluster but be a good thing to do when you don ' want to progress the story speak of the story I really can ' judge the story base on my opinion because of my style of gameplay but when I can say be that there be more dialogue and a lot more cutscene than a regular Pokémon game all in all I support the gameplay direction that gamefreak be try to do and hopefully this can be a regular occur series and that some of the idea will be implement into gen 9 and beyond I be a big Pokémon fan and I hope that gamefreak will finally turn around the quality of game that have be release these last few year 
some review for this game baffle I decide to post my own because some of the review here make the game seem well bad than it be claim thing that be straight up wrong and some of they aren ' even review but just rant against the fan developer half of they also give I the feeling that the writer didn ' even play the game 8 10 from I the game actually shake thing up when compare to previous Pokemon game the new gameplay formula be actually fresh and interesting this game revolve mainly around build the first Pokedex of the location where the game take place the Hisui region in previous game fill up the Pokedex be do simply by catch a Pokemon and the whole page for this Pokemon would be fill up immediatly that be not the case here catch a Pokemon will only get you so far in this case despite what some other claim here to fill out the rest of a Pokemons Dex entry you will need to interact with this Pokemon in a variety of way catching and battling be obvious but there ' more to it see it use certain move evolve it find different form gender feed it and so on all of this will get you close towards a complete dex entry thankfully you don ' have to do every task to fill an entry when compare to previous installment the total number of Pokemon in this game be low than usual there be a total of 242 Pokemon in this game some may say this lazy on Game Freaks end but I personally think that this be fine fill out the pokedex would be a nightmare to do if there be a lot of Pokemon which be a problem since that be the main focus here also again despite what other may claim there be plenty of new animation present for each Pokemon so have a low amount seem fair every Pokemon also have their own personality in the wild this Pokedex and catch focused approach make for a fun gameplay cycle speak of the wild this game isn ' just your standard Pokemon RPG there be 5 big open map for you to explore each of which be unique they be well design exploration be reward with collectible item and Pokemon but not mandatory Catching Pokemon be handle differently here too you can do it the standard way by battle they and weaken they but you also have the option to catch they outside of battle you may want to take a different approach depend on the Pokemon you be after some be docile some be hostile and some be easily scared you can choose to sneak up on a Pokemon use the environment around you or lure they out with food if you be be attack you have to dodge their attack initiate a battle or throw object at they to stun they the new type of Pokeballs complement this system well the battle system have also see some change specifically the new attacking style and turn system the turn system be previously just do with the speed stat decide who go first but now the speed stat be more important a high speed can give your Pokemon multiple turn back to back but this also apply to the opponent the new attacking style also impact this as a strong style move make you slow but more powerful while an agile style move do the opposite both style also take more pp than a normal move you can also walk around during these battle but this doesn ' have much of an impact on anything some battle will even have you outnumber against multiple Pokemon at once due to the setting story of the game trainer aren ' very common but they be present Gyms Leaders aren ' here and have be replace by the Noble Pokemon these be essentially the boss of the game and have you battle they unlike any regular Pokemon I ' sure you have see this plenty of time but graphically the game be sub par the main issue seem to be muddy and low re texture bland lighting lack of shadow and reflection and some performance relate issue render distance of object and the framerate of NPC ' Pokemon Graphics don ' mean everything but in this case it ' all very noticable and should 've be well the game run fine at 30 FPS overall with a few stutter here and there Music Sound design however be some good stuff but this have always be a strong point for this series I ' no expert on story but what ' here be fine it ' pretty interesting mainly due to the set First two or so hour be pretty dialogue heavy due to tutorial and whatnot and could 've be a bit less Quality of life improvement be definitely present the good change here be probably a well gameplay flow thank to the well menu design and less menu ' in general Overal a big step and a fresh take on Pokemon a new approach to gameplay and a fun cycle keep I invest with quality of life improvement everywhere Graphically sub par bur story and sound design be fine interested to see where Pokemon go after this I ' say it ' worth full price 
regardless of my initial skepticism I believe this be a really nice fun game I wasn ' really sure I would enjoy this entry since I have always be more focused on pokemon battle with gym and the pokemon league rather than complete the pokedex this game be solely relate to complete the first pokedex there aren ' many trainer battle which be make up for by introduce new challenge for example alpha pokemon I think they nail the gameplay loop quite well Arceus introduce an open world game where collect and training pokemon be a lot of fun and engage I haven ' enjoy the late main line game that much Sword and Shield Diamon and Pearl remake and Arceus really feel like a much needed breath of fresh air for the series this be not the good pokemon game ever make nor be it go to satisfy everyone if you be interested in a new take on the Pokemon series where you can freely explore a world full of pokemon in an engaging setting then this game could be right up your ally 
roughly 15 hour in and love the game so far obvious complaint be the graphic some Pokemon don ' exactly interact with anything but that ' about it story wise it ' a tad more mature than the old title which be always nice I love the catch mechanic and the lack of a ton of trainer on every route be incredibly refreshing all the character be unique in their own little way move animation be beautiful and I love the new battle system honestly everyone say this be the bad pokemon game ever need to go back 2 year and play sword and shield 
solid game very addictive gameplay battle be so streamlined compare to Sword and Shield they take about 1 3rd of the time to complete this time there ' actually incentive to catch they all graphic be a huge letdown compare to BOTW Music be good not as good as BDSP where the game shine be the gameplay I wish the world be more open like botw with less hand holding but compare to other pokemon game that feel like they be on rail this be a breath of fresh air 
finally some fresh air in the pokemon franchise yes the game do not look good yes it contain glitch but after all those year fan prayer be hear a kind of open world with roam and living pokemon everywhere a new way to catch they and new method to complete your pokedex 
the graphic be just bad but that ' the only big point the gameplay feel great and I think this be a really good step for the next Pokemon game the good Pokemon game I play on Switch I hope this be the new gameplay for future Pokemon game the rewarding system be also fine and the side quest be okay with voice actor for the main questline and well graphic it would be a 10 10 still a great experience 
this game have a lot of what I have want from a Pokémon game it ' really good it ' like the devs come together and say we be tired of the complaint Let ' make a well Pokémon game it get lot of good stuff a cool story a fine collection of Pokémon interesting character some mystery to solve excellent music overdue quality of life change refined and addictive catch and battle mechanic an interesting and sometimes beautiful world to explore it ' simply close to the Pokémon game fan have want for decade the graphic be mostly ok and can look good and they certainly don ' take anything away from the experience they be just rough and there be pop in and low re texture most importantly though it ' a lot of fun the game clearly take some inspiration from Zelda Breath of the Wild but it simply lack thing that BotW get and those be thing it would need for a rating anywhere close to BotW thing like well texture voice act more modern graphic large more detailed area more ruin and generally more to explore more settlement and camp Pokemon should be do more than just walk around aimlessly and sleep dynamic weather affect gameplay well quest and side quest etc the game be still too much fun for a 7 10 imo 
the game play be amazing it ' finally a redesign of the original formula the boss battle be great fun my only complaint be the graphic be really weak lot of alia artifact and the pixel be very clear that ' more of a switch limitation would be nice to see a pc port for a similar style game 
I ' 30 hour in and it ' amazing the first 2 hour be a pain in the ass and I feel like they guide the player so much it ' infuriate I ' prefer it if the game let you learn a lot more by yourself the mechanic aren ' complicated at all so there ' no need to explain everything like it ' the first time I ' play a video game in my life the combat system be fluid and you can enter a fight beat a pokemon and then start do something else right after the only compaint would be that it ' lack a bit you can ' summon more than one pokemon at the time but you can fight against four if there be a way to summon more pokemon at the time or if the attack could hit multiple target it would be well something interesting be the fact that you don ' have to fight a pokemon every 5 second if you prefer to you can almost play the entier game by just catch pokemon and gather ressource I ' really like to have a sequel with well graphic and polished mechanic that ' pretty much all it need to be rate 10 10 
I ’ll start with the bad while the gameplay have evolve the method of story delivery have not change a bit since the day of the DS lot of reading and one big climactic fully render cut scene in this fully expansive 3d world 85 of the story be still dull cutscene with text box after text box and no voice act while this isn ' inherently bad nothing interesting be provide to keep your attention the animation and rigging be downright lazy at time and the human character expression movement be uncanny despite their brilliant design every time you interact with a human it shatter the immersion as they play back the same 3 basic movement the story itself be decent but be hide behind layer of tell instead of show ie black screen and sound to imply something be happen I find myself just press the button in rapid succession to get back to the actual fun part the graphic be the next gripe it genuinely look like a Wii game or old and it doesn ' seem that Gamefreak developer have the time to truly optimize this game for the system it ' on my girlfriend who doesn ' play video game at all comment that it look like an old game the first time she see I play it optimize take time so it seem they just dial down the graphic to focus on other more important thing while the game look great sometimes and the 3d model be beautifully design the graphic can not be overlook ugly texture object randomly clip through each other character detail like hair be flat and lifeless hover 6 inch above the ground in some area you get it now here ' where the game get literally everything else right my first Pokémon game be Pokémon Diamond and this be the most fun I ’ve have play a Pokémon game since then the core gameplay be downright addict as the act of sneak up on Pokémon learn their behavior stun they with item choose when to battle be just chef kiss it really feel like you ’re in the world of Pokémon run around just catch the little guy like you always want to as a kid the wild battle be high stake a lot of the time as it only take one alpha Pokémon to knock out your whole team I find myself feel genuine terror the first time I see that alpha rapidash something that be MORE than welcome in a Pokémon game in this regard it ' everything you could want until that pesky story get in the way it ' easy to spend hour upon hour just fill out research task it ' a huge jump in the right direction for Pokémon as the old battle mechanic run their course over a decade ago it ' also exceedingly clear that this game be Gamefreak ' love letter to sinnoh from the music placement of landmark and overall design of the wild area it ' really fun to feel like you ’re explore the past version of the region you explore as a kid the moment you realize you ’re in Eterna Forest or one of the legendary lake with the music to boot be second to none you win ' enjoy this game nearly as much if you don ' have the nostalgic tie to Sinnoh Overall while this game definitely drop the ball in a lot of area it pick it up and run with it in so many other I ’ve have hour upon hour of genuinely bewildering experience play this game just by run around and catch Pokémon the way the Lor Arceus intend the gameplay be second to none and it ' a shame that gamefreak didn ' get the proper time to see this game all of the way through 
one of the good Pokémon game I have ever play of course it have its flaw like graphic pop in and empty place but it be still very enjoyable and I appreciate that the Pokémon Company take a risk and I can say it be worth it 
great new direction for the franchise fantastic world building and lore expansion and fresh battle mechanic all make it the good pokemon game in over a decade Let down by the graphic and somewhat grindy aspect 
this game be a preview what future pokemon game should look like the Gameplay be great and with the pokedex quest quite entertaining but it be lack in some basic for example no breeding no abilitys no special evolution Mega ZStones or Dinamax Though I like some graphic element grassstalk attack the overall graphic be garbage the diffuculty be unexpected high I be continuously underleveld and have trouble to travel area without rest the trainer battle be to easy not level dependent but with abilitys item this could improve the difficulty I really hope they continue evolve the series in this direction and maybe even do this in a big scope and with well graphic 
not prefect there ' some graphical issue and lack of voice actingbut all around refreshing change for gameplay Gamefreak make a good Pokémon game since gen 5 
the game be great and game freak really do a good job try out new thing the only thing that be miserable be the graphic 
a lot of great point about the game it be not the usual beat all the gym then move on to the elite 4 and become the championstory make sense and the new feature be great like be able to fly work with pokemon the game be also hard than the previous game pokemon sword and shield which be also a good thingThe jubilife village theme change the more you go into the storynot to forget that your character and the wyndeer get dirty depend on how much do you travelto the con nowGraphics could be much well and it look like a game from the 2000s do not mean the game be bad the price of the game be questionable but nothing can be do with thatPeople who go on to say the game be bad without play be ignorant 
75 100gameplay be barebone as everything in this game but it ' already so satisfying go around and throw PokéBalls 
this be the most untertaning Pokémon game I play for year yes graphic be kinda ugly and there be some visual glitch from time to time but that ' really anecdotic when play de game the soundtrack be a sweet mix of nostalgia and modernity and the sound design be awesome the gameplay be innovative and can get a little spicy especially in postgameI would recommend this game more than any other Pokémon game 
I have not play the entirety of this game but so far I have really enjoy this new Pokémon game Sure the graphic could be a little well but with the open world experience and that you can catch pokemon without have to engage into battle it ' really awesome 
in summary it be a classic game of Pokèmon I would have prefer open world than open map and graphic maybe well here we be at the level of Unity crap however the leveling system be strange throughout the story you can also go to equal level but towards the end you be require to have a team level well this I call it unbalance and not good at all I sincerely hope that for other game in the series they improve start from their negative point but know Gamefreak 
the most fun Pokémon game I play in year the new gameplay of mix of stealth and combat be very polished progression in game be lock behind what your star rank be so it ' give you motivation to catch and do Pokedex research in the game Pokedex research be simple and easy to do come do to how many Pokémon you catch to how many you have beat in battle or what type of move you we to beat a Pokémon the big complaint I have be the Game Engine they use think it the same one Game Freak use for Sword and Sheild with texture pop in slow and the pop in before Pokémon do which can get annoying texture with glitch out in battle and wild Pokémon will randomly clip think rock and tress make they uncatchable and graphic aren ' good at all but its Game Freak they never work on that 
a great step forward for the pokemon series however need work honestly the most fun I ve have catch pokemon and run through the world this game have revamp the combat system as well as the pokedex I would recommend this to anyone who have play pokemon and people who have be want something more from the franchise the reason I give this game an 8 be even though the world be fun to run around in and the combat be interesting the game do look pretty bland mostly due to graphic this be surely a great step forward for the franchise but there be a lot of room to improve 
this game be a promising evolution for the Pokemon series and I hope the direction the series will go in I be absolutely addicted to the gameplay loop of navigate the open area and do the different requirement need for each Pokedex entry I highly recommend this game to any Pokemon fan 
my God the world envrionment be ugly af Gameplay be really good though I would say that if you be able to look pass the story lack of multiplayer battle system gym battle and the horrendously bland and lifeless world of Hisui this be an alright game to pick up but with a company as big as Game Freak it feel kinda lazy and they should be do more 
complete in 20hours be extremely boring story no gym or league easily exploit gameplay that allow I to catch everything with a single ball and no aggro graphic so old it look like ps2 era no idea why people rate this high than sword and sheild when it ' half baked game add ability to throw a ball which be in pokemon go so it ' nothing new 
legend Arceus as just a game without its franchise would definitely be mediocre it be a collect a thon with some QoL element a serviceable plot subpar graphic and a musical score which while charming be a bit too subtle in the overworld the fact that it have a full game price tag would definitely turn some people away with that say as a Pokémon game it be pretty damn good not great but good the game ' new focus on it ' old catch em all motto have turn out to be for the well why the good way to describe why be to address how this game deal with the complaint previous entry have receive Same Old Gyms and Championship no and no your exploration of the world and your capturing of Pokémon now serve as the goal post for your progress Trade Evolutions go with an in game item animation while the model and art style of the world be bad they be more expressive than I remember they be in both BDSP and SWSH too many Cutscenes Dialogue Boxes Plot be to the point catch em all and do quest to advance you will not be keep from the game for too long at any point level Capture Block go not to worry though catch a strong Pokémon be not go to suddenly break the game for you the one thing that be still restrict be the level limit of your Pokémon obey you catch one out of your league and it will not listen to you too much experience while you do still have EXP share it ' distribute well and more sparingly if I can catch a Level 40 rapidash in the starting area due to a fluke and only get a few level I ' say it ' pretty balanced Grinding suck the focus be on catch and that be where most of your exp be go to come from just sneak and throw no long battle necessary except in certain case you can battle but battle suck this game give one hell of a boost to your opponent they can abuse the special mechanic you can use and the strength in level difference be not as pronounce now you have to play smart since the combat isn ' just single turn switch anymore listen if you want a Pokémon game that would erase all of the past controversial entry this be not that game it be very fun but as many people rightfully think this could have be do soon and well still I can ' help but really enjoy this game maybe it ' just a one time thing but I sincerely hope that the fun I be have now be a sign that Gamefreak be go in the right direction with its game development 
this game be a step in the right direction open world change of style and gameplay be sorely need after 25 year the graphic be not top notch but man the gameplay be fun they take a risk although not far enough but it be the good Pokémon game in year now they need to push far make it truly open world create well AI for roam Pokémon interaction with environment well animation Add gym back in the next one allow we to ride your own Pokémon on ground air and sea add more town and city to explore More cave and dungeon add more raid and add a multiplayer aspect maybe something akin to Destiny where 30 50 player share the open world with you at any give time again step in the right direction can ' wait for the dlc and future release with this formula excited for the future 
this be a solid 7 10 gamehere my reason bulletpoint and then a short explanationfirst positive a step forward for the franchise overworld map be big then expect 2 3 pokeball choise be amazing a bunch of the bossfight be great only a few trainer battle and most of they be decent you never feel burn out by they you barely get annoy by the rival alot of good character design customization be decent riding feel great and be fluid go through map be good oppertunitie to catch rare mon be there and they be good you can catch every mon of the game include special evolution trade evolution have an item now and that s amazing a few rly good siequest some of which can permanently alter thing and that s amazing sometimes the game look good new fighting system be interesting some sideobjective that be kinda neat legendary battle be nicenegative the game be kinda flat in content map feel empty with nothing to do in they overworld be fill with overly agressiv pokemon who will get aggrod from insanely far away forway too long map can feel like hotroom where everybody want to kill you and that rly fast some sidequest be downright * * * * the wisp thing be interesting but kinda dumb too a radar would have be good for this no minimap and that would have be need alot ride camera be unacceptable its horribly bad wild pokemon be insanely unbalanced my lvl 80 maxe out mon can get murder in 2 turnsby a lvl 30 mon that just can not be a thing wild mon can alot of time attack you twice before you can even do a single thing pokeball can bounce off the air sometimes its simply not possible to gaige if a ball can hit sometimes you can not catch a mon because the catch range be not enough and that s rlyinconsistent somehow the story be kinda wack and I do not rl know wth be go on in the grand scheme of thing whatis even happen the game be OFTEN ugly flat and just bad boring design wisethis encompassesstyle its a poor man breath of the wildpresentation its a poor man breath of the wildvisual washy colour look flatstability this game be not rly lagging but anything far away then you can throw apokeball will look like it be lag out or load in half pokemon just stand around only a hand full of they be actually do something ponyta forexample will try to play with you but rly most of they want you dead and there be not rlyanythe between most of the time we desperatly need some defensiv mon that wouldbalance it out by help you or fear away mon progression be kinda meh there be definietly a well option here for example pokemon half of the lvl of the mon that will obey you should not attack you anymore so if you command mon up to lvl 50 mon of 25 or under be not agressiv towards you or give clothe property like well stealth or something like that its rly lazy yeah in total alot of miss chance but still it be a totaly playable game and while alot of time be good the game manage to piss I off BAD when my cam while ride NON stop get stick when pokemon would permanently break my stealth out of nowhere when my pokeball do not work because I be 1 cm to far away which suck alot of time when a wild mon 30 lvls under own mon ONESHOTS my mon and then I get option for battle even if I engage they like wtf bro 5 10 be mediocre = sword and shield 4 10 be less the mediocre = BDSM remake 6 10 would be an improvement over the last game without anything big 7 10 be when a game improve but its not fully realize also washy and inprecise control to earn anything aobe this 8 10 the idea be realize and also a bit deep * * * * work fine 9 10 the game be outright amazing and for the time it have be release be up to date which this game 100 be not it look like crap run almost as bad and feature seem rush 10 10 the game actually push forward what it mean to be a game of that genre + it work fine and be at its time beyond what other deliver this be not the case here the game 100 underdeliver and prol need another 1 2 year of pure development to be this good so what s could have be do in 1 2 year of more development clean up the game add more thing to do in the overworld coop for the map like they do in bdsm underground or wild area increase stability polish visual add a few more behavior for the very limited pokedex all of this could be possible EASY and would make the game a 10 10 other game manage to accomplish this and pokemon be a billion dollar franchise no excuse in the world can excuse this not be the case this thing sell million of copy 
it ' good but it ' lack some heavy graphical feature that game from past 2010 have for the price it ' not an excuse the switch isn ' powerfull enough anymore we be in 2022 not 2008 
I ' nearly 20 hour in when I ' write this review my first impression for this game be that it ' probably the most unique pokemon game by far the fact that GameFreak decide to try something new in a Pokemon game without reuse the previous pokemon formula really impress I overall the game wasn ' really mind blow but it do lay the groundwork for future pokemon game there be some other stuff to be work on such as the visual and graphic Voice act in Pokemon be always somthe I want in the game and it ' kinda disappointing that they continue to overlook that aspect although I love the new game mechanic of catch pokemon that be implement I feel that the map in this game be really empty and lifeless at time the mission in the game could be tedious at time when they force you to catch pokemon in a amount to progress all thing consider it ' a good Pokemon game that could have be well and I hope that GameFreak will continue to improve their future Pokemon game as they be go down the right path with Pokemon Legends Arceus 
this game have the potential to be a masterpiece unfortunately the lack of voice acting and polished improved graphic prevent it that be say this be still a good game and worth the adventure for pokemon fan it have I so excited for the future of what pikemon game have in store I truly hope they will give one pokemon game the time and love it deserve to make a game as good as super mario odyssey and breath of the wild this be the close we have get to it but there be still a long way to go 
it ' good feel fresh new catch system be great it just feel kinda rush thou and like it want you to mainly be re catch the same Pokémon all the time to fill out that Pokédex and there be even less emphasis place on story and battle I don ' like how there be almost no trainer battle as have high level good Pokémon be pointless 
the new style of gameplay be fresh and exciting however I feel disappointed by the lack of PVP pokemon ability and hold item the open world aspect be fun and questing feel more like a modern rpg than pokemon while the graphic of npc and the game in general be laughable the gameplay be smooth when throw pokeball and use a mount to transverse the open world 
you may want to stick this review out it ' a rollercoaster ride there be two drive force in this game one force that take the game in either direction in the direction of be a good game there be the amount of fan service in the game new form of Pokémon an regional origin story new strategy to collect Pokémon Breath of the Wild menus sound and gameplay the negative drive force however be how long it take for the player to be able to enjoy these thing it isn ' as if the player be always learn new thing that they must use in the gameplay the opposite actually almost everything need to complete the game be hand to you right off the bat this be not an inherently bad feature this kind of freedom allow each player to create individual experience and choose their own way to complete each task sadly in this game there be no choice to be make it ' simply a game where you build your collection with new environment only serve as a change of scenery even then the same forest area be use for a majority of three out of five area finally the graphic be unacceptable this be something that can be look over when we talk about quality since gameplay be most important but it ' a sad thought when you realize every once in a while how poor the graphic be with all of the complaint somehow someway this game make I return to my desk and continue where I leave off the night before why be I come back what kind of game do I turn on and start complain about Freedom for once you aren ' just a Pokémon Trainer you be a collector a researcher the one that other look up to you be the obstacle in their way from the very start for Pokémon fan this story be one they have want to know for so long and want even more of in the future it ' Pokémon history be play out and create by you the most important thing in the entire game be collect and study thing about Pokémon that have never be such a large focus Effort that ' what this game have it ' not the norm for the developer it ' unexplored territory they make their mistake the game have it ' flaw but it have the soul that a good Pokémon game should have they didn ' leave out crucial feature to make the game more marketable to wide audience they didn ' make the story simple so everybody could follow it it ' a huge chapter in the Pokémon world and one that ' worth experience even through the flaw in it ' core as fan we all have our opinion about this game but this game will absolutely be build on in the future and be a foundation for the future of fun in the Pokémon franchise 
a good improvement on the Pokemon formula the gameplay loop be awesome if you be a completionist like I the thing that be be the score down be this game be either unoptimized on the switch or the switch be not powerful enough for the game I think a mixture of both be true there be a lot of pop in and I have see other game that shouldn ' be able to run on the switch be able to run quite well so this be disappoint the other thing be the small Dex size 240 Pokemon for a franchise that be right around 100 be too small to reasonably charge 60 buck 
at first sight Pokemon Legends Arceus seem to be the game fan have be plead about for all these year an open world game where you can freely explore the land and fight Pokemon in a way that be true but the execution be very flawed the game be restrict to zone otherwise know as an open zone game this be a disappointment especially when the early trailer make it out to be a game similar to BOTW not only that but the game restrict you from enter certain area of zone if you haven ' fill out enough of the Pokedex however this shouldn ' be too much of an issue as long as you be do more than just follow the mission the main gameplay loop be very fun be able to explore freely in the zone of course and catch fight or run away from Pokemon doesn ' get old well at least for most of the game it start to tedious after a while especially because it ' require to access certain area the Pokemon don ' do anything interesting they be completely lifeless they either walk around sleep or occasionally teleport depend on the Pokemon why not have some Pokemon fight with each other occasionally or have two Pikachu ' touch their tail as a greeting which be quite literally in their Pokedex entry stuff like that which would make the world feel more active the zone themselves be bare bone with only the most basic terrain not to mention the graphic be awful for a 2022 Nintendo Switch game the terrain look bad than game on the GameCube when you aren ' follow the main story or explore the world for fun you be probably do request otherwise know as sidequest these sidequest be the most basic boring and tedious task you can think of they be all the same catch a specific Pokemon fill out a specific Pokemon ' Pokedex entry or collect a certain amount of an item to bring back to the requester it feel like do homework go through these however there be a couple of fun one one of they you get to catch a shiny Ponyta but like I say there be only a couple of these it feel like the developer be ask to make a sidequ system last minute so they have to rush like 100 of they and make they all practically the same thing there be a story but it ' pretty awful every cutscene be just two or more character stare at eachother with 0 sound effect or voice acting and these cutscene happen all the * * * * ING TIME the tutorial of the game be like an hour long and you be CONSTANTLY be interrupt whenever you get a chance to actually do something these interruption be not as frequent as the tutorial throughout the rest of the game but that isn ' say much TL DR Pokemon Legends Arceus have a great concept but it ' incredibly obvious Game Freak half asse many thing it ' not truly open world and the restriction place upon you really take away a lot of the fun you could have however despite all of this the gameplay loop be still incredibly addicting and fun to the point where this game deserve a 7 I hope we get more game like this in the future in which all the issue be iron out because this game really have potential 
the game be very fun and addictive but the graphic be terrible and the gameplay feel like a Pokemon GO with open area element like Monster Hunter it ' surely an enjoyable game if you be a Pokemon fan but we deserve well and Game Freak need to take their time and make a fantastic game that can be forever remember not just rush game development and put low effort so they can make money from game every year 
Pkmn Legends Arceus PLA be a step in the right direction but still show how Gamefreak GF make minuscule progress in game design let I start out with the good I haven ' have FUN play a Pkmn game in so many year and finally a game deliver on the fun I haven ' feel a pkmn game have hope to be consider a good game until now that be say I be baffle at why GF make this game bad than it need to be fan have be complain at how long tutorial be and this game ' tutorial be a pain to play and yet for all the new feature in the game the tutorial teach you none of they really its essentially just capture a pkmn tutorial to I that ' sort of the story of this game Fun to play but the game refuse to let you enjoy it there be so many cutscene in this game that take you out of the experience why you still can ' skip they be beyond I why I still have to wait for each text scroll before I can continue to the next one make no sense to I honestly if this game have a skippable tutorial and skippable cutscene or just none at all it would be a much more pleasant experience the sad part about that complaint be that GF have no excuse yes the graphic be awful but there ' a million excuse I can give for that no engine switch can ' handle it time constraint vs risk of project success etc but the tutorial and cutscene pacing be a conscious choice by GF that could 've be avoid I ' glad this game exist and I ' hope GF can merge all these change into a new mainline series of game as of right now PLA be a step in the right direction for GF but unfortunately a super safe dive at change and a continue display of antiquated game design I would love for GF to continue along this path and not give up but this game be not quite there giant leap for a pkmn game but I be tired of give Pkmn a pass just bc I love the franchise so much 
I like the exploration Mechanic ' but sometimes the game feel too repetitive the mission would be more epic I keep farm and explore all the time the alpha battle break this a little but I miss the epic battle at gym 
definitely a weird Pokemon game the bad the graphic be bad and they only get worsethe story be not very good and the lack of voice act consider the graphic doesn ' do the game any favoursthe game want you to complete the Pokedex but a couple of really BS long term collectathon puzzle that artificially pad out timemost of the good part of the game be lock to after the credit or even 50 hour in the story be gate by Pokedex progressionThe good explore area and find new Pokemon be funthe game have make fill the Pokedex a significantly more active taskThe new battle system be well and create close and more strategic battlesthe final act of the story be enjoyableThe soundtrack have some genuine bangerspokemon Legends Arceus ask you to complete the Pokedex fully to unlock the whole game to be able to then turn around and appreciate the value of what you play but a big if here be how many people be really go to do that at least 80 of player be not go to reach the very end and be as a result go to leave this game having experience a mediocre story with an enjoyable final act some player will reach the end of the post game story quest which genuinely have an awesome conclusion and be honestly challenging but very few be go to reach the very end this game be rich with little optimisation to the Pokemon formula the rock and tree that you throw your Pokemon at to gather resource for craft be a great system the ride pokemon that allow you to travel fast over water and through the air or up mountain be a great system the addition of Strong and Agile Style and the Move Order really make long battle way way well once you get a grasp of how to work the system it be excellent the cheeky move you can do and your opponent will also do make battle significantly more even fight than ever before it be unfortunate that very few trainer in the game have large party of Pokemon that allow the system to shine craft be great for the most part wild Pokemon behaviour be great the Pokedex challenge that change from Pokemon to Pokemon keep the game fresh the boss fight be a good idea that have a lot of potential but some of they didn ' land this time around this game be bring down so much by its graphic and GameFreak ' pull punch the game be simply ugly the ugliness of this game never relent and be at all time make the experience bad than it could be texture be constantly be reuse Pokemon load distance can be fine but it can also be abysmal with Pokemon load only if you be a few metre away if you be fly over it feel like GameFreak hasn ' try and that this game be more so a pitch to the playerbase ask how do this new gameplay loop feel to I this game have land well because I have always enjoy the catch pursuit of the game I want to see where this game take we Gamefreak have do some excellent thing with this game and from here it ' a matter of trim the fat like the artificial time sink or the story progression gate and refine what else have potential here battle go largely unsung and that be a shame Pokemon feel more alive than ever in their environment boss fight be pretty cool the story be one of the good Pokemon story and it really wasn ' good for the most part improve and add more of these part of the game that have potential and eventually we will have a great game 
I love this game I think it be one of the good if not the absolute good Pokémon game that have ever be make I also think it will be a contender for GOTY which will be a true achievement for this game and the series I be score it as I have because they seem to stop work on the game at a point and just accept it where it be on the Narrative this game have a story which loosely make sense it ' interesting it capture the imagination of everyone from the new trainer to the most harden veteran but there be part where it just doesn ' seem to go far enough each boss fight feel repetitive with no real mechanical change present in they other than the monster you be fight there be part of the game where the narrative do genuinely tug at the heartstring and make I as the player feel that I be an in a real world with people in it that I should care about but also after the initial scene of you wake up on a beach in a completely different time era there be basically no mention of try to get home I understand that the point of the game be in fact to catch Pokémon but even if at some point during the collection of the research something be mention along the more we learn the close we be to figure out how we might be able to get you home would be more dynamic it all feel a little lazy and like they couldn ' find a way to start the story so they just through in you come back in time on Gameplay really the gameplay be incredible for a Pokémon game I don ' feel like I ' just make these incredible creature fight for no reason instead I can just catch Pokémon in the guise of research and then release they as a regular part of the game it be a truly amazing step for the series every throw of a pokeball feel great and each time I craft something en masse I get a little shot of serotonin know that I make my own pokeball however for some reason that be never explain narratively or visually I appear completely unable to climb even the simple hill nor can I swim for some reason the reason for these hinderance as a player be obvious they don ' want I to access the area early when the Pokémon be strong but at least make it visually or narratively interesting can ' make it up that hill it ' because it ' too steep and you don ' have climb gear or maybe it be rain so it ' simply to slippery to climb you can ' swim because Pokémon will attack you or maybe because you as a character don ' know how to swim at least give I a reason for these road block in a game which proudly call itself open world final thought this game be a tremendous step forward for Pokemon as a series it add a new breath into something which hasn ' truly experience new ness in what feel like over two decade I hope that they take this side series to a new area in the future as well whether that mean an ancient Hoenn region or perhaps ancient Alola anywhere but KANTO I also hope that whatever the next main series game be it borrow from at least the innovation in the gameplay so that Pokémon be see less as competitive tool and more like the subject of research that the game proport they to be 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be a bold new step by Nintendo and Gamefreak that would have be outstanding several year ago PLA do a great job of make you feel like you truly exist in the Pokemon world and do a good job immerse the player through all of the new mechanic it present catch new Pokemon be more dynamic than it have ever be before you can choose the old route start a battle weaken the enemy then attempt to catch they or you can utilize the open world and item you have at your disposal to distract feed or even stun they and simply throw the ball it be even possible to use this method to catch Alpha pokemon unaware and capture they without need of a battle there be an all new craft system as well while it be quite simplistic it do get the job do I find myself go out into the wild simply to gather material for craft action to reward Basic good job the game also go a solid job offer new more powerful item as you progress to make it seem like you be actually improve as a member of the survey corps Story wise it ' what you ' expect from a Pokemon game solid enough keep your attention for the most part but nothing remarkable there ' no wow moment in the story nor be there any moment that elicit much of an emotional response towards the end I be skip dialogue because I just want to play the game the battle themselves be largely the same the ability to run around be interesting for the first couple of battle but after that I forget you even could and stop do it altogether there ' no real reason to move around outside of see different angle Pokemon don ' randomly target the player character in battle and as long as you don ' stand directly between the Pokemon fight you be safe from harm some status condition do get update which feel long overdue now the bad the game look terrible the game run terribly unacceptably awful for a full fledge console game in 2022 Jagged edge frame pacing model pop in and out of existence and several graphical glitch plague the game and severely hurt the score it be either time for Gamefreak to find a new game engine or for Nintendo to find a new developer This do not cut it to be clear I like the art style they try for it could have be a very aesthetically pleasing appearance but it just isn ' it be ugly and be very poorly optimize the retail price of 60 do not reflect the amount of polish put into this game very disappointing presentation for Pokemon on the Switch Again all in all I greatly enjoy my experience and will likely playthrough the game several time I know in this world of hyperbole and dramatic a 7 seem like a low score it ' not this be a fantastic step in the right direction Ball be in their court to improve upon it 
this game be definitely a fresh take on a repetitive formula the main focus of the game be on collect pokemon and it do that well than pretty much any other game in the series however it also at time feel like you be play test an upcoming title for one the graphic look like something from 20 year ago furthermore the main plot could be improve by voice act however many vital feature like breeding or online battle be just completely missing 
a huge step into be the pokemon game I have dream of for year but really could 've use another year of dev time to add more and to polish More than any other pokemon game you can feel the Pokemon Company ' crushingly strict bi yearly release schedule in this game stifle this game ' potential but in all it ' as fun as pokemon ever be ignore that 
7 good yes there be some major flaw with this game but it be definitely a step in the right direction for Pokémon 
an extremely fun and enjoyable game this game be a pokemon game that I have be wait for to be make it take element of other open world game and add it into the pokemon universe the combat be extremely slick and seem almost fresh but old to some gamer the one thing I wish be build upon more be the visual although Pokemon Legends Arceus be a very fun and entertaining game it lack in the visual department but that doesn ' mean it ' a good game Overall 7 10 
New Pokémon Game you be not buy this game because of the graphic but because you can fill the first ever Pokédex and find various type of Pokémon 
Pokemon have generally be go in the right direction let ' go and Sword Shield bring in the 3d aspect that Game Freak deny avid player for year the system in Pokemon Legends Arceus in term of battle and capture be unquestionably superior to every Pokemon game precede it the death of the battle screen be satisfy to say for the least the in world interaction be a great addition my issue be the well look battle be few and far between there be not many Pokemon trainer in this game nor be there gym if the storyline have induce the building of town settlement upon completion that lead to more trainer and the first ever gym the game would have be 1000 more effective while this game certainly succeed in put old and tired mechanic to rest it fail by forego the aspect of competition my hope be that Arceus will remedy this by way of DLC and hopefully much more expansive dlc than those we see in sword shield all in all this be certainly a well direction for the catch battle and exploration aspect of the franchise 
besides the hirribal graphic and some physics the game be great gameplay wise side quest be a bit repetetive 
TLDR it ' flawed but a good Pokemon experience at its core this game be on to something but Gamefreaks execution be pretty disappointing I still enjoy play Emerald and FR LG I really don ' need perfect graphic but I think the graphic in this game be pretty laughable only to be out do but the overall world design it feel empty the texture be all the same but explore the world be fun and catch the pokemon be also fun hopefully GF let someone else take over make these game in the future but if you like pokemon you will like this game 
it ' a fun game but the entire battle aspect of the game be essentially put on the back burner and forget not nearly enough opportunity to use the team you assemble love the new mechanic and open world aspect but the graphic be rather poor 
the good beta I have ever play this be the good way to summarize this game the world lack depth and it feel empty graphic could be easily improve the difficulty be too low even for a Pokemon game there be no real Pokemon fight until end game there should be an option to choose in which difficult mode you want to play I be no long 8 year old and I no long want to play versus a trainer that only have 2 pokemon after play 30 hour of game also too much pointless dialogue 
while this be the shakeup that the Pokemon Franchise desperately need ultimately it be flawed in its execution the game play be great the story not so much I find myself just get through the story without care much about anything or anyone Catching Pokemon in different and unique way be fantastic strong and agile style feel like they need more time in the oven Performance be unacceptable for a game that look this poor the game feel as if it need more time to reach excellence I be happy that everyone be enjoy their time on the game though however I feel it be disingenuous to give this game a 10 10 with glaring issue such as these 
the standard for Pokemon game be at an all time low while Legends Arceus be by no means bad it continue the trend of a barebone game that feels immediately outdate in a franchise that just doesn ' seem to grow it ' a backwards step maybe a reduction of the formula to set a new foundation for later game but it ' just a bit too late for I the world isn ' an enjoyment to traverse it ' hinder by be visually underwhelming but it just lack a sense of activity the pokemon exist only for the player they don ' interact with the world in any meaningful way they be just collectible in the past this wasn ' as big of a problem because create a team to conquer the league be always your goal here the pokemon be the only real goal yet they just linger as mostly aggressive or timid creature not really display much if their nature or show character maybe you be now think I expect too much and yes I do I expect a lot from one of the most successful franchise of my lifetime consider other title in the franchise have have feature that would be suitable here but as be the trend with Pokemon game we lose 3 feature and gain 1 and yet here we be with one of the most well receive game in the franchise in a while if only it seem because the game be just about good enough be it a step in the right direction absolutely be it a good pokemon game Sure in a vacuum of just pokemon game it may be one of the good but I ' of the opinion it should be well call it entitle but having support the franchise since the first iteration I do think the fanbase deserve a game of much high quality which now leave we in the position we be all in we want to support the good part of the franchise in hope we get well version of that but the excitement and initial highly positive reaction from just get something that isn ' a disappointment mean the quality of this game which be quite low be more than enough for a company that just want to make more money it ' an okay game it ' not bad but it ' not great and when the honeymoon period wear off we will be back to a state of disappointment as we wait for something truly good 
I have complete the 100 of the game last night I will always recommend this game to the franchise ' fan but not without many criticism this game change the game play completely with many long await new mechanic that we can only hope will stay in the future game it ' still a major improvement from the past game especially the recent BDSP remake unfortunately the technical aspect of this title be lack and may lower the enjoyment of this experience by a lot it ' sad to know that your avatar be explore a forest just because of its name appear on the top corner and not by the visual environment it ' unsatisfying have many place very similar to one another inside the same map the art direction be great as always but the immersion be ruin by its lacking we know of this lacking by the trailer but I would have still grant an 8 out of this game if not for another very disturbing aspect the writing in this game be a new low Pokémon have always have childish writing but in this instance every other dialog contradict the one before we be in a time where pokémon be fear but 50 of the village population be from a well establish region where they already have pokéride HM and be live peacefully with the pokémon we be tell that no one know how to capture pokémon then they explain to we how to do so they tell we we be the great battler but we have a teacher for that way more skilled than we we be tell that all the pokémon be fearsome then we be show other character know that there be many specie that be very peaceful toward they and easy to catch or to live with I know this game be mostly for child but I would love to have a game not contradict itself so often the combat mechanic be an improvement but they need some fixing especially while battle other trainer if you build like I a slow team it might occur that when one member be KO the next one enter will have to wait 2 3 move from the opponent result in another KO without be able to do anything in late game I have to rethink my team because one trainer attack 13 time in a row demolish my team this be not a rise in the difficulty but some design flaw since I might want to play with my favorite pokémon without have such a disadvantage and all slow pokémon fill penalize over all the game be a good one and the game play loop in enjoyable if they keep work on their optimization skill and fix up the few problem this game could be a new starting point for the brand 
I really enjoy play this game and it ' cool because this be what all pokemon player ever want but 1 why no one have voice in this game 2 need more anti aliasing when play docked3 need more character animation for some choice in game like press a stone button instead of chat selection 4 need a well way to track side quest and track pokemon progressionsometime I feel the dev team have some lazy decision about some aspect of the game but in the end it ' a good refresh for the pokemon game franchise and I expect more on the next game like online coop battle arena and more 
finally the franchise go out of its old classic gamestyle compare with other JRPG nothing look increadible but Pokemon charm be very strong from technical point of view PLA look like 2002 game with bad art direction 
I have play about 40 hour of legend Arceus it ' a good game be there a lot that could 've be do well absolutely be there some thing they should 've expand upon yes be it a step in the right direction though certainly the gameplay be arguably the most important aspect of a game and I be happy to say that what Legends Arceus provide be strangely satisfy when look at trailer you may be concern that the environment have nothing to really explore this be somewhat true the terrain can be a bit dull at time but there be also time where you will find yourself wander into this hidden corner of the map and you will be reward by various thing even when the terrain isn ' too interesting you will find that the Pokemon and item you pick up will make up for it when it come to the request it can be a bit mix some will be really interesting slightly comedic in an almost Pokemon anime fashion or wield some cool reward other however will just leave you look up how to complete it on your phone due to it just be a boring scavenger hunt I don ' mind have to look for stuff but I think some hint that would narrow down where to search would 've make the experience a lot well the battle with Noble Pokemon can be surprisingly difficult and have a very consistent difficulty curve the only one I have issue with be in the Cobalt Coastlands and that ' mostly because the arena make it feel like you be fluff your way through it until you finally manage to somehow beat it it be still fun but it could 've be well the one in the Alabaster Icelands have to be my favorite it ' hard but it ' a fun type of hard the trainer battle be for lack of a well description interesting at the beginning of the story it ' very basic and comparable to Sword and Shield ' battling by the time you get to the post game though it lean more towards the almost unfair territory you ' expect from Cynthia in Platinum and arguably beyond that the battling itself have change a lot in this game and my feeling on it be a bit mixed on one side it add a bit of strategy that be appreciate on the other side it can seem a bit unfair and annoying especially when some Pokemon out speed you right out the gate the new status effect be actually pretty cool and I wouldn ' mind if they be implement into Generation 9 the craft be also a nice touch and surprisingly well balanced overall I give gameplay an 8 10 the story be fairly average until you get to the post game a lot of it feel like it could 've go deeply or be explain with less press of the a button I think two thing that Game Freak should learn in the future be to show rather than tell and to not repeat a single point several time it ' well than it be in Sword and Shield but it still need some work the last plot point in the post game be definitely worth it though the story be a 7 10 for I do not expect the good in Legend Arceus graphic and animation some terrain from far away can look downright ugly and not properly portray what ' actually out there for instance if you look at the Heartwood from the Heights Base Camp almost all of the tree be nonexistent the anti aliasing can also be really weird at time especially around water the animation department be actually a bit well in comparison it isn ' quite Monster Hunter level but most of the animation be good enough to keep you immerse there be time mostly while do request where it ' somewhat obvious that they take some shortcut but it ' nowhere near as bad as Sword and Shield 5 10 for graphic and animation the music be one of Legends Arceus high point it ' blissful when you go into the Heartwood or traverse the land at night because the music just bring you in sometimes you don ' want to battle Pokemon just so you can hear some of these track without interruption there be two track that play in the Cobalt Coastlands that take I out of the mood though Cobalt Coastlands 1 and Cobalt Coastlands 1 Version 2 be reference the Diamond and Pearl ' Route 210 track and while it fit Diamond and Pearl ' track it doesn ' really fit the feel you get in the Cobalt Coastlands which be a nice chill day at the beach but with a pinch of danger the music have more of a sprint to the adventure ahead sort of feel there be also time where I feel that the Battle Wild Pokémon track get a bit repetitive maybe if there be slight variation depend on where you be that would 've make it a lot well there be also this one trainer battle that I wish have some more dramatic music to it instead of the normal trainer theme all of these be nit pick though and didn ' in the way of my enjoyment much an 8 10 overall I hope that Generation 9 and future Legends title if there be any improve upon this and make something truly great there ' promise here 
although this game be a good one compare to bdsp I do not understand how people can call it a 10 10 I ve play the game around 40 hour or so and I have to say the only thing that make this game enjoyable be the mechanic the story be a solid 3 10 at good and the graphic be truly horrific I m a fan of old game and do not care about graphic but visual bug and disappear asset be truly bad its a shame because BOTW manage to do graphic way well so its not about the switch rather than the game 
you all probably know what ' good about this game already so I will go ahead and just list some negative that have impact my overall impression of it Subpar graphic Breath of the Wild look way well than this back when it be release five year ago low framerate it ' 30 at good but often far below that the camera be constantly shift on its own and there ' no way to make it stay in place empty world aside from pokémon wandering around and some farming point there ' nothing else to find anywhere no trainer no point of interest no treasure chest etc you can ' switch pokémon inbetween turn in battle story npc and wild pokémon can fight you use several pokémon at once but you be stuck use a single one even in those battle have to go 1 vs 3 isn ' uncommon unless you be fine with waste precious money to buy poké ball you will have to craft your own this in turn mean that you will end up have to farm resource which be more than a little tedious to actually add a complete entry for a pokémon in your pokédex you need to fulfill som criterion like catch a certain number of that pokémon defeat a certain number of that pokémon and so on it might seem like a fun addition on paper but be force to do more or less the same task over and over and over again for every single pokémon get annoying pretty quickly the fly mount isn ' actually fly but rather just glide make it borderline useless for travel unless you start off on a high plateau Clunky control while ride mount even if you be close enough to an enemy to focus on it that doesn ' mean your poké ball will reach it you will often be a few inch off alert the pokémon to your presence and potentially make it turn aggressive a lot of pokémon have a very long aggro range make they impossible to approach unless you sneak up on they from behind Sneaking be extremely slow so the pokémon you be approach will most likely have turn around and notice you by the time you be close enough to actually hit it with a ball if you be hide in grass and throw a poké ball that then fail to catch a pokémon you will be notice and probably attack by that pokémon even if you be still hide and should be impossible to find Boss fight against frenzied yellow pokémon be godawful the dodge mechanic be clunky at good and the window of opportunity for send a pokémon in to fight the boss after it ' be injure enough be frustratingly narrow unless you do it basically the same second the message pop up on screen the poké ball will just bounce off and the boss will recover what this mean be that you will usually be stick slowly whittle away the boss entire hp with throwable item 
okay first off I hate the hand holding at the start this game be not fun but it be pretty it be worth the full price as art not a game 
the new mechanic and the direction in which this installment move the franchise be very enjoyable however the game seem unfinished the mission be repetitive and the visual section get in the way of the enjoyment of the game this delivery have value and be enjoyable for the change it introduce but it be weigh down by the constant sloppiness in the visual section and a development of mission narrative too simplistic and repetitive 
change the review I put a score of 3 first because the first 5 hour with the tutorial be terrible like everyone have like 5 year old but after that the game improve not technically of course because be terrible but related to gameplay and fun be not that bad nothing revolutionary here maybe for the franchise yes but not in game in general nothing that a MH game do many year ago but well if you be a fan of the franchise enjoy but just average to I 
Pokémon be slowly turn into a cheap jrpg the graphic be shockingly bad with a very poor frame rate the tutorial last for over an hour and that ' with rush through dialogue the game interrupt you constantly from play to force you through bland and generic NPC cutscene with forgettable character that have nothing to interest to say the world be barren and have very little atmosphere and nothing worth explore People that excuse this game deserve the mess that it be Update if you can stick it out for a few hour more then the game let the training wheel off you and you can start to have some fun still not great 
this new Pokémon game have an interesting concept but the fresh air be not that well execute Exploration be quite nice although be not the good in open world gameplay graphic however be bland and outdate it look like on 3ds 10 year ago which be pretty disappointing since the let ' go game be very good look well than Sword and Shield but still low in my Pokémon list and in my Nintendo Switch list I suggest you to buy it end of year start of 2023 when its in discount Bland but still a little bit fun 
1 step forward 2 step back brilliant diamond get a lot of crap but some of the quality of life update make in that game make I have some of the most fun I ’ve ever have in a Pokémon game I really think feature like access pc from anywhere and infinite bag space be forecast what we would have go forward in the series Nope they decide to make those thing more restrictive than ever collect item to craft what I need be tedious and intentionally time consume Clearing my bag because I can ' hold anything else be incredibly frustrating those be the big thing make this game less enjoyable than it could be but there ' so much more I could mention if I feel like spend hour type it out not a bad game but could be so much well 
PROS decent story fun gameplay restructure pokedex log task that be intuitive and entertaining craft mechanic that tie into open world gathering you get to ride a menagerie of impressive pokemon and the platforming be decent new evolution for old favorite slick battle animation item management survival aspect with punish consequence stealth mechanic that add another layer of skill to catch and or battle wild pokemoncon short of establish a new camp or farming plot all side quest reward be virtually useless and a few of they will require an unpleasant amount of your time to accomplish sloppy lazy gameplay pad the game have very little content compare to other entry in the series ~40 hour postgame have little purpose it ' just a dex grind no multiplayer PvP there be only a handful of trainer battle 98 of battle will be wild pokemon encounter boss fight be essentially janky unmemorable minigame mediocre graphic that have no excuse for run the system so hot while look so badverdict it ' clear that the game albeit somewhat successful be a market test wait until they release multiple dlc or just buy Sword or Shield if you haven ' already 
so there ' a lot I really like but there might be just a tad more that I dislike Idk if I be to give it a rating probably like a 6 overall it ' fun but it ' mechanic get a bit boring after a little and the story and graphic be bad than game from 15 year ago the story doesn ' get interesting until you be in like the last arc of the game I love what they do with the game and if they be to expand upon it in sequel the legend subserie will certainly be my preferred way to play Pokemon but as it stand idk 
Pokemon Legends Arceus have a great deal of potential lead up to release but the end product be sadly lack it ' nice to see a major attempt to revitalize the age old formula that ' remain largely unchanged since the Gameboy but the execution be muddle Catching Pokemon in real time feel great alongside the overhauled battle system but the content of Arceus be simply too repetitive to be enjoy in the long term the open world environment be only really fun to explore the first time around the variety be really lack and the Pokedex system require multiple capture and interaction with the same creature make the experience a bit of a slog the style of the game be initially appeal a game set in the distant past of the Sinnoh region be conceptually very compelling unfortunately Arceus fail to live up to it ' premise and it ' world and environment tend to be totally without life and character there ' only a single proper town and there ' very little in the way of meaningful interaction here the graphic be noticeably subpar for an official Nintendo release with plenty of minor visual bug to distract you from the experience the story be another letdown as throughout the game ' considerable length nothing of note really happen it ' a very basic set of event but the game can ' help itself from include wall upon wall of text the character be really not at all memorable and only serve basic story function before be leave to the wayside this be a shame as many of the character be really well design and several represent the ancestor of character from Diamond and Pearl which be a pretty interesting concept so it ' a shame that they feel like such a throwaway element of the experience although I be initially quite excited to learn about the world Legends Arceus take place in this enthusiasm quickly fizzle over the game ' playtime and the story petere out in a disappointingly obvious and expected way I wish that I could separate the disappointing part of Arceus from it ' promise new gameplay formula but that ' simply not possible the new gameplay style could be a great new direction for the series but it ' simply too repetitive in this current iteration to be compelling past the first few time you experience it it ' also a major letdown to see how utterly lifeless the world character and story be as these element have the potential to be legitimately compelling and explore the world of Sinnoh in exciting new way Legends Arceus be probably worth check out if you be a fan of the series and want to see a new take on the gameplay formula but don ' expect much more than that 
without doubt a step in the right direction the open world approach be simply the correct way to go with such a franchise it look awful the pop in be terrible some texture be legitimately ps2 quality if you look up at the sky and then look at your foot the frame rate drop consider that Breath of the Wild a 2017 game can run a much well look much more stylized world with much well performance on the Switch this be just embarrass the Pokemon in the wild don ' seem to do much all and be not organic e compare to a deer in Red Dead Redemption 2 I will not be tell to compare this game with BotW or RDR2 because Pokemon make a * * * * of money every goddamn year it be simply the big franchise ever think big than GTA RDR Zelda Star Wars Marvel etc they be bind to deliver something well to their fan it doesn ' even have voice act because they don ' want to spend the money what I want to see next time * a fully open world not different section as here with actual people and town and building * actual mission and quest other than catch this many Pokemon those be just fetch quest * all Pokemon include animate and full of character * battle gym badge and a Pokemon league with good AI * well resolution texture frame rate and overall performance before that I just can not give this a positive score 
PLA be a fun game that be really rough around the edge there be part of the game that make I kinda want the game to get on with it and part where I be actually engage with the story with that say the game play feel very bare bone and repetitive make I wish that there be more to it story 7for a Pokemon game the story in this one be actually pretty decent even though I feel they have to use leap in logic for why people act or why conflict sometimes happen in order to progress the story forward which isn ' a bad thing just isn ' groundbreaking in its own right just happy to have stake in a Pokemon game again Sound 6there wasn ' much music that really stand out to I mostly because I swear I couldn ' hear it overthe Pokemon in the wild the end song be really good though Graphics 5I agree with everyone else that the graphic of the game itself isn ' really that good and for the large medium franchise in the world they could have step they up but at the end of the day it could have be a lot bad than we actually get Game play 6the game play be fun at the beginning but the main issue with it be the fact that it ' pretty much the same thing throughout the entire game with the only break in the monotony be the boss fight which be genuinely fun to fight against because it wasn ' just a regular Pokemon battle Final Score 6 10pla be a step in the right direction for the Pokemon franchise and I really want to see what they do next with this type of game play style even if this instalment feel extremely bare currently 
nice gameplay you can see the evolution of the series but disgust technical condition and art design 
this game take player on an extraordinary adventure in an ancient Japanese theme world of Pokemon where you get the chance to befriend the legendary Pokemon Arceus Let ' hope everyone forget about Pokemon Conquest so we can make that sound more original ok to be fair I don ' hate this game I think this a great reimagining of Sinnoh its not the remake I want but I still have a pretty good time I be hesitate at first discover that the final Sinnoh remake be go to be a spin off game really disappointed I mean in let ' go the catch mechanic be vastly different compare to other game but they be easy to learn and its a lot like the original Pokemon game where everyone could learn Reflect but this a whole new Pokemon world brand new catch mechanic and an altered battle system it ' all diverse and while the battle system be ok at good I ' really impressed with the new catch mechanic stalk careless Pokemon in the tall grass like a true hunter and then smash they in the back for the capture its really satisfy it ' definitely the game ' big strength this game definitely isn ' for battle fan but it be rather design for those who love to complete the Pokedex it ' a world with no version exclusive and trade item be equivalent evolution stone Nothing ' hold you back this time to catch all of those pocket monster personally my favorite part of this experience be probably the Alpha Pokemon they remind I of some old PokePark memorie only these Pokemon aren ' piss off they want to tear you to shred it ' so exhilarate try to catch these guy they roar so loud that its send your character fly the add size and the glow red eye really add to intimidation it look a lot like the classic Mystery Dungeon box art it ' just give I another reason to love they they be over level and be as strong as most legendarie which make it all the more satisfying to build a team out of they do you know how awesome it be to build a team make of Alpha Sinnoh starter it ' like a dream come true and I will also shout out the reason I call this be a reimagine Sinnoh be because if you listen carefully you can hear remixe level theme from Diamond and Pearl all across the game Eterna Forest Mt Coronet the work the Celestica Flutes sound just like the old title screen and there ' plenty of Sinnoh Pokemon to set a nice familiar tone to the game I like the new Pokemon form fine but it put a great smile on my face to see hundred of Sinnoh Pokemon spread across the land including the Platinum entry yes move over half ask Diamond and Pearl remake this be how its do well for the most part the game be great even with my half broken controller and a few sprite glitch I be still have a fun ride but the charm of the character start to wear off after I defeat Avalugg I bet a lot of people question this part when they back at the game why the hell do Commander Kamado kick you out of the village for some reason he suddenly accuse you the child suffer from amnesia who have be do nothing but help Team Galaxy and save the Nobles for cause the distortion threaten the region of Hisui at this point of the game a lot a scene in the story feel force the Commander suddenly turn into an antagonist and there ' some extra backstory for the Charm Sisters and I just don ' care some of the boss fight in this game be annoying and I ' not a fan of all the side quest but those be just nitpick an RPG game doesn ' need a breathtaking story to be good but Kamado ' motivation be childish it feel like the writer just make his character an antagonist because the first climax wasn ' exciting enough this be just as weak as Sword and Shield ' antagonist and as for Volo as the true villain I have to ask do anyone care the final fight take place after the main story credit so most player be likely to miss out on it its not really build up well and sadly like the new Cynthia in the remake the developer make this fight unnecessarily difficult in order to entertain old fan I like difficult Pokemon challenge but do you really think the battle system be a highlight in this game the game start to feel small when I start to climb Mount Coronet not put the effort to remake the Distortion World or summit level long be a huge miss opportunity I can ' listen to the sweet remix if the level one take a minute to climb the main gimmick be a lot more entertaining than the conclusion the character be vibrant an dit feel good to build a team of my favorite Pokemon but this game really need something more if it want to be remember hopefully the DLC this time around will be worth purchase because this be the most fun I have have with a modern Pokemon game in year I hope that Gamefreak will return to greatness someday one step at a time 
the underrate shouldn ' not be everyone only E10 + what ' with the rating pende and this could be harmful for little child the story be like parental guidance and the gameplay be like Monster Hunter World or rise like open world or zone the game frame rate be not enough to adjust 60fps and 1080p and the graphic be too similar as Sword and Shield however the music open world area and quest that I like be much well like music it be very calm and peace that I can relax my brain without express anger I can believe you don ' have enough strong graphic and frame rate be because I ' very disappoint that you put low quality even though you compare the Breath of the Wild the only you compare be Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise be this a hub system the battle mechanic be not bad strong and agile be much combination but I ' confuse about the turn also the move be too small so I be disappoint that all the move about 75 be go the difficulty of battling be tricky and everyone thing they can ' win a high level like post end it will start over without check point the 3d modeling be doesn ' make sense like Pokemon have different color and it ' confuse think it be shiny no more trade evolve YAY the fan think the trade evolve would get steal and refuse to give it back I ' impress you add new item like link cord return to quest the money be too low and the rank progress be too slow when progress the story also waste poke ball that you catch be a limit amount and you will waste and buy it again I think the Game Freak be use the same graphic that the AAA ' be have a technical issue rather than find a good engine to create their own by themselves also it wasn ' not much fun with a multiplayer 
nice game compare to the last Pokémon Gamesa but the graphic be poor and the game have to improve a lot this be the way 
this game be definitely a step in the right direction however GameFreak now need to build on this foundation we need More settlement interesting location a well tell story with voice act maybe More interaction with the world especially by the pokemon Pros finally a step forward for the pokemon franchise Fun action centric boss battle catch pokemon feel great way well difficulty spike than old gamescon horribly bad storytelle even more handholding than in a monster hunter game the world feel liveless and the Pokemon do not interact with it or eachother Boring environment there be no secret other than the one you have to discover for the story 
play Legends Arceus be fun Game Freak finally try something new improve the gameplay make it feel fast and some more positive thing its the right direction for the pokemon franchise and hopefully a bunch of improvement will find there way in the main Pokemon game as good as the gameplay story and direction be you can not ignore the technical and graphical problem about this game and it should be call out and criticize the art style be not the problem it look really good when you find the right camera angle when you look at the world of Pokemon Legends Arceus and compare it to similar game with their world like a Monster Hunter Rise on the switch or even other exclusive like Xenoblade 2 Pokemon Snap the upcoming Kirby game and Zelda Botw and many more legend Arceus look awful as if this game be a Steam pre alpha game or even a N64 game when you compare some area with a Zelda Ocarina of Time there be a lot of pop up of tree etc the main town be the only one in game and most house be just copy and paste awful environmental visual a lot of area feel very empty and there be also nearly no point of interest for a game that want to you to explore the world of course there be no need to have a game with next gen graphic or a more realism look but you have to have in mind that this game be a product of a big video game company with the big franchise in the world they generate million of dollar and can not deliver a game with a visual standard that fit the size and popularity of the franchise Pokemon Game Freak have the finance to get help by other studio like every game do nowadays even a Halo Horizon etc get help by many different studio the console be not the problem as you can see all the way well look exclusive on the switch and when there be a lot of crunch time its a company decision to put the game on the market in a high frequency with just the essential content and visual to get enough positive score by medium and the game sell overall the game make quite fun because it use a fresh optimize gameplay and go another way than the main game but you have do decide if you want to spend your money for a game that look like a game that be stucke in the past of the Xbox360 PS3 era or even at some point low compare to other actual game it feel like completely low effort product with no detail and soul at the end its a decision whether you want to support this course of the company Game Freak or want to see a way big change of the big franchise in the world 
the game be promise but not really worth a full 60 the graphic be poorly optimize still Sword Shield actually look well no promising change on the battle system with exception of you as the trainer move around thus take out the multiplayer be completely unnecessary dumbe down to 242 poke in the region which may upset alot of other trainer catch mechanic lack potential cut the middle man between traditional Lets go Stealth mechanic be poor well off just catch on foot or battle Story be an average Pokemon story with minor grim tale Abilities Natures no long a thing but EVs iv be still in the game despite no competitive battle 
legend Arceus be an expensive tech demo through and through through the past several year in the transition from 2D sprite work to 3d model GameFreak ' make the risky move of turn Pokemon into a console title with that shift have come a noticeable drop in quality particularly in the department which manage the compatibility between title Sword and Shield have a reduced Pokedex and rather sparse content and Legend ' Arceus follow suit by deliver a really unique playstyle overshadow by a game generally devoid of content the ancient world of Sinnoh be bland and miss a lot of the diverse biome that typically populate a Pokemon game on top of generally feel empty as a whole if you love Pokemon you will probably still enjoy this game as I do but I can ' shake the feeling this game should 've release as a free demo with the team dedicate more time to flesh out the world the mission and the overall Pokemon experience I ' not sure if GameFreak be just look for a cash grab or have just grow plain lazy but Legend ' Arceus will hopefully not set a precedent and be just pave the way for a much well game down the road 
good idea terrible execution Pokémon try to innovate in a game that seem to be make with an absolute lack of love for the franchise even though it include some nice addition to the classic formula it keep repeat some of its most classic mistake I ' not even go to mention the art direction and the graphic issue because everybody have see it it can still can be a very enjoyable experience though but this be definitely not the good Pokémon game in year it ' not even close extra point for the effort put in try to innovate but we shouldn ' praise Game Freak for make a game that feel so unpolished and sometimes even unfinished 
its a half baked game for a price of AAA game feel like game from 2005 no voice just text can not jump can not pass terrain graphic be horrible just bad texture no effort to make some art if it can not render proper graphic you would expect 120fps on switch with graphic as bad as this but think its barely push 30 World have lot of pokemon throw in but besides feel rather empty no sense of wonder while explore just dull you can read good stuff from other people make it go into good direction or well then previous doesn ' make it a good game 
I love the game for the first 15 hour of game play it be really fun and the interaction with the Pokémon be really good but when reach the later area it start to feel a bit repetitive and empty I understand that the world be suppose to feel empty but this be too empty the graphic not good I normally would not mind but it feel unfinished for the hype this game get and the fact that Pokémon be one of the big franchise for Nintendo I be kind of disappointed I have high expectation 
the game be an over all breath of fresh air and I truly like the direction it be go the story be decent the control nice and the pokémon don ' seem as bland as they be in previous Pokémon Titles it be fun but as a fan of the series for 20 + year I can not ignore the many inconsistency npc sometimes move their mouth while talk and sometimes not for e the uninspired landscape and cave specifically the horrific graphic especially light and shadow work and lilac shimmer on the ground for no apparent reason and framerate the annoying repetitive dialogue the pokémon glitche up tree and the jokingly bad render distance of a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY in the year 2022 the Gameplay however be really fun not perfect but fun and I really hope the next legend game will improve the thing it clearly lack as off right now great potential 
visual be an improvement but still very bad for a game in 2022 Game play be fun at first but get very repetitive catch trash pokémon over and over again 
this game be a breath of fresh air that pokemon player need as gamer and content become very repetitive great idea let ' hope gen 9 for move on and expand our expectation for a good pokemon game 
this game be a step in a new and exciting direction but the world feel eerily dead and unfinished for example there be a severe lack of music when run around the map the pokemon just stand around stare into space instead of play chase each other the pokemon specie all just kind of spawn in group at certain spot without much variation the graphic be rather poor you can finish the main story in about 10 hour like with most pokemon game its too easy there be some cool thing about it though especially the open world aspect there be also fairly challenging event with rare pokemon shiny pokemon to catch and quite a few legendarie to catch I enjoy it but yeah something about the emptiness really put I off the game 
let ' say be a good experiment but the battle be a mess little amount you can avoid almost any battle you want Doesn ' make any sense it ' Pokémon GO all over again you catch they all and that ' all you don ' need to train they because even boss can be beat without even use a single Pokémon and the joke be that they all be wine experience even if you didn ' use they battle system be a mess and leave so much to be desire like enemy pokemon be poison I use calm mind to buff myself for the next Pokémon their pokemon use agile style and attack their pokemon die to poison and another come in new pokemon use quick attack new pokemon use agile style attack new pokemon attack again and when my turn be finally here Calm mind effect expire a joke I understand now why there ' no held item or ability they surely need to improve this in future game also story be bland the postgame be epic but doesn ' make much sense and the tutorial be the long this franchise have Don ' get I wrong I like the game because catch and exploring be do well than ever and that make this game really fun to play it ' by far the good part of this game but the rest be just Meh 
Game be really fun at first due to novelty got really bore really fast I be struggle to stay awake most of the time the story be very bad don ' let other tell you otherwise it ' backwashe horse semen just bottom of the gutter story item be annoying item storage even more so only hope I have for this be that there be more than 3 zone and hopefully some free patch if I could go back in time I wouldn ' have buy this this Pokémon game be my last one I just don ' think Pokémon be for I anymore 
get very repetitive and lock the main story behind level grind for a game call Pokemon legend it have very little legendarie the catch be super fun but the battling be break and not as fun as fight people it feel abusive to fight wild pokemon 
ok this be an average game run around the world and catch Pokémon be my dream come true since I be a little kid the first time I experience this be with pixelmon now I must say this game be ugly horrendous texture and lod pop in landscape be a blur with detail from the ps2 era I ' guess all budget go into animation Animations be a solid 8 10 move look good Pokémon idle be alright and the model be some of the good for the story there be one nothing to exciting like in past Pokémon game it ' very basic for people rate this a perfect 100 100 be insane as for the one give this a 0 10 this be a very average game which I think be an honest review Hopefully game freak evolve with this and step away from their past safe zone I recommend buy and play the game 
so the game be very fun at first but the luster wear off badly as it go initially I rate the game an 8 but as you play you see the ugly visual battle be terrible in this game the style system be horrible barely any move lot of battle where it ' you versus multiple Pokemon that can all potentially have multiple turn each before you can even do anything you can send in a Pokemon and have it die without even move if it ' slow because of the style the boss battle be a mess the first couple be fine but by the 3rd you start to wonder what the designer be think certain attack be basically impossible to dodge and it go against the idea of the game be more simple spoiler example Arcanine it ' whole thing be it dash across an arena with lava and you have to leave enough space to dodge he fine then he just put a massive fire ring in the middle of the arena that completely block anywhere to dodge sideways as he tackle but if you go in the ring you die it ' a mechanic that make no sense and just feel frustrating and cheap because it doesn ' require you to react or dodge more you just can ' move out of the way of his attack at that point but it ' just dodge a tackle still like they take all the fun and complexity out of the actual Pokemon battle but the boss fight be a nightmare of poorly design attack to try to dodge while throw balm there be also a lot of small irritate thing like 1 save file or how small the satchel be in a game where you be suppose to be constantly gather thing the game be fun when you be just out catch Pokemon but it have a huge laundry list of problem that only Pokemon could ever get away with like any other company or game series would be drag for a game with this many issue and outdated system 
graphic anren ' very good I swear there be reuse asset from phantom hourglass ds on this game Sound ain ' good either Most of the music sound like elevator music and the sound fx lack any energy Pacing be extremely slow the game hold you by the hand the entire time and there be far too much text to read it get boring quick not much variety in the world not alot of depth to the combat you be not do much of it either Character desing be ok see pokemon move around be kinda cool 
the graphic be objectively terribleThere ' no voice or gruntington and ton of dialog and cutscenesIt ' not really open world more like section of open areasThe music be uninspiredboss fight be boringthe first 2 hour be a trudgefeel like a fan make gamegameplay loop be alright and the craft be a coolIt try to mimic the botw charm and fall far short in originality gameplay graphic music animation bugginess performance control etc in all I mean if you be a pokemon fan you be go to get this but if you be just think about get into pokemon this game will probably disappoint 
mediocre game it do get some thing right like the seamless battle and quality of life when it come to change moveset but otherwise this be a step back empty ugly world where the battle matter very little since you can just stealth and throw the ball at everything even when you get into one of the few trainer battle they be too offense base to be any fun thank to the new system this be only a good game if you just like catch pokemon and nothing else but at that point why not just play GO too much be sacrifice like a develop region with town and the ability to battle other online 
Gameplay be bore you just throw your pokeball to the pokemon and that ' it the boss be just orrible the graphic even worse 
a lazy reskin of the BOTW area ' with low preform grapich and a bland overview I really want to like the game but it ' just a sloppy overall job they should just have take one more year and polish the world I be afraid this game will do what al 4 pokemon release before have do get in with a great score and then be reduce to a 5 because the nostalgia have wear off 
non existent plot repetitive gameplay 2006 graphic the only thing to do be throw ball at the pokemon 
for a game that compare itself to Monster Hunter and Breathe of the Wild it doesn ' live up to the expectation the frame rate and graphic make it look like a very solid ps3 game hope it get patch and if so my rating will go up honestly only a game Pokemon fan would be okay with 
overall for a Pokémon Game the change they make be exactly what we have be wait for for year the issue start once you realize though this be not a Open World Game and technically even less open World than previous game they straight up steal the World System from Monster Hunter where you have a Central Hub fill with npc you can converse with merchant and craft capability of which they didn ' really even use recipe they already have for example only brown apricot be in the game prevent the acquisition of pokeball such as the Love ball or Premier Ball and then Exploration Zones which be just Wild Area ' from Sword and Shield but large the Alpha Pokémon be just permanent weak version of dynamaxing which be nice but not really anything new they be suppose to come with special move but those same move can just be buy from the move trainer for money Money never think a Pokémon game would make money redundant but I waste my first 2 million just buy move for Pokémon I end up release back into the Wild eventually some recipe cost money and can be costly upwards of 50 000 so far but I make 2 million before I even quell the first Noble you don ' need to buy pokeball or potion or their upgrade version cause you can just craft they Bag Space be kind of expensive after awhile but after the first 15 upgrade I have never have an issue with run out of space before need to go rest and recover pp the game isn ' even anywhere close to open World the Central Hub be separate by a loading screen between every region region of which you can not travel between without go back to the Central Hub and walk into building cause loading screen that be a Closed World they have Wild Pokémon spot ' where a group of something specific will spawn in large number but that only happen to 1 region at a time and only when you go back to the central Hub they also have these thing call Time Distortions which summon Evolution Items strong Pokémon perfect for level grind and coloured plate and star dust which can be craft together into star piece but only 3 or 4 will spawn in a region at a time afterwards you be force to go back to the Central Hub again if you want more of these to spawn before go back to town your also force to turn in all of your currently finish research which give you money and xp towards your Star Rank the Star rank what be the purpose of these I be 7 Star and all Pokémon of all level would obey my command before I even quell Kleavor that ' the equivalent of 2 Gym Badges in previous game which mean by time I actually get into the Mirelands every one of my Pokémon which I collect 1 of each one in their Alpha Form and Shiny Forms be all 1 hit everything include the Noble of the Mirelands the Miss Fortune Sisters and all the Trainers Trainers where be all my trainer at I have rush to unlock Braviary and now stop to actually perfect the Dex but like where be the trainer at you fight a handful of Leaders and Wardens of the Diamond and Pearl Clan and even give out ball and Pokémon to people to start they out but the only real trainer encounter be the Miss Fortune Sisters who ambush you from time to time where be my follower POKEMON like seriously Yellow HeartGold SoulSilver Lets go these be some of your good game because of the follower Pokémon stop remove that feature Combat Evolved I notice and love the fact that you go out of your way and remove redundant move such as Harden and condense they into their other more significant ability like Iron Defense but where ' the Pokémon Combat this would have be a perfect game to allow we to control our Pokémon during battle and do combat like an rpg instead of turn base Dodge Block Attack all of that could have easily be do instead of be able to run around during combat as the trainer kind of redundant there and a little useless for a feature although yes I do say this be the game we have be wait for for year I have to lower my rating because of the fact they keep remove feature of their series that actually do very well and attract people to their game all in all I have spend over 100 hour on the game already and have perfect 115 242 available currently hopefully with future update and dlc they can fix some issue and maybe try and actually make an open world game not just claim it to be one and steal the concept from someone else 
as I predict same STUPID director = same stupid game unfortunately the fanboy will never admit it they think they can call themselves gamer because they like pokemon lol as predict I know gamefreak be go to use the timeline as an excuse to not add gyms trainers championship less directing need be not nintendo fault be just that sadly gamefreak own part of the pokemon franchise 
an okay game but GameFreak could do well the total game content be not so satisfy it should be more from a Pokémon company 
it would be nice to put the budget to use from time to time actually it would be the first time ever game freak actually utilize the budget I ' just speechless the only way I could start to enjoy this game be to imagine myself as a kid again be affirmative of anything pokemon relate you ' have to be practically stuck in the 2000 to appreciate this game I just I don ' know what to say it ' a garbage game 
the game be fun but be * CKING UGLY JESUS CHRIST I have a indiferent hate relationship with the progression 
a solid baseline for the future but the game lack of some fundamental feature the story and the graphic be really terrible but overall the game be funny for a future chapter with several improvement I could think to give a well score but as today the game be still under the 6 
honestly I will say no to this game I really apreciate the zelda way attitude but game freak need to pratice more graphic be not really good and movement physics be a little inaccurate you can not swim a little you can not check your life or stamina Positive that they try to make the boss fight more fun with another way to fight but overall it ' a mediocre game but an improvement over the old game of the past 
honestly overall it ' not a bad game the graphic be that of a Nintendo 64 game and I can ' count how many graphical error I have run into however the mechanic and new battle style be honestly really cool and I have a lot of fun battling although the story seem pretty shallow and not super well think out which be nothing new for a Pokemon game to be honest overall I think it ' definitely worth play but not worth the 60 price tag 
a good step forward for the brand but with a ridiculous quality Gamefreak should leave the technical development of the game to third party 
here I out I love Pokémon I ’ve be play for over 20 year all the mainline game but I have to be honest and objective to myself I ’ve be play and play and play for 15 hour be it a bad game not at all but I don ' think it ' good either my main complaint be battle they be completely ruin the system be just all over the place there ' absolutely no balance I hate the new style I never use they Pokémon in battle attack you twice something just because no style use sometimes even 3 time ability would help with battle but they don ' exist etc I just feel like battle be a complete mess and that ' wild Pokémon battle because proper battle with trainer don ' exist you have some battle every 10 year with a trainer who use 1 freaking Pokémon 1 the area be too big imo it ' not a bad thing but it ' extremely confusing and sometimes annoying and I lose interest on explore because everything be the same but with a different Pokémon walk around I know some people love massive open area but it ' not my cup of tea I like something more in the middle the craft be annoying way bad be the satchel limit that you have to pay a ton of money to get just 1 more spot for an item wtf I win ' talk about the graphic we all know they ’re not the good and they didn ' really bother I for I it be other stuff that be bad than that as mention before there ' way too much talk nonsense talk way too much I find it dumb af you can ' go from one area to the other you have to go back to the camp every single time to request to go to the village and then again request to go to another area that ' just dumb and a waste of time can ' believe they pull this on we you can ' change Pokémon and access to your object to store they it be mandatory to go back to the camp again to do so not much qol there and don ' even get I start on lose a ton of object when you pass out I absolutely miss battles real one I absolutely miss GYMS have a more marked objective and go to the Pokémon League etc some people may like the type of game Legends be but Pokémon have be always about battle gym the league and be a Pokémon master the good I play when I ' bore when I stop play it take a lot for I to go back to the game doesn ' really hook I I force myself to play to at least finish it game wasn ' for free I have to say I love the overworld Pokémon and the possibility to see shynie I like the battling when you just send the Pokémon and that ' it it ' very quick and I appreciate that I personally hope this be just the typical spin off game it hurt to admit I have way more fun with Sword and Shield I hope Gen 9 take the good mechanic about this game like the overworld pokemon quick in and out battle etc but it ' more focused on the typical gym etc and not so massive area be be the good Pokémon game everrrr as some people say hell no it ' not even the main essence of the franchise it ' not bad but not the good either at least not for I give I back my competitive battle and gym I would give it a 5 10 
the game take a whole new direction in a different setting the visual be much improved and the gameplay be rather addictive it truly feel like how pokemon should have always be explore and see pokemon in the wild 
IGN Italy ' review be the most accurate critic review of this game that reviewer understand how to analyze game system and how they interact with one another instead of just be mindlessly wow by an open world with a few genuine improvement to the traditional Pokémon formula and there really be some improvement they simply seem to have be make without any consideration whatsoever for how they affect the rest of the game let ' start with the good Non random seamless battle be great want to get into a fight with a wild Pokémon Toss out one of your own Pokémon near it and bam you be in battle no loading screen no battle transition effect just instantly in battle mode and you be still free to move around at will while the battle be go on see it from any angle even get hit by the attack if you be careless with where you stand Don ' feel like battle you can catch Pokémon without be in battle now which be great not all of they mind you but some of they these be the two main alteration Game Freak make to the traditional formula they be good idea unfortunately they have some noticeably bad knock on effect which it seem Game Freak either didn ' notice or compensate for in rather amateur way previous Pokémon game have the luxury of hide all Pokémon in tall grass and outside Sword Shield never actually show they in the wild this mean the presence of the Pokémon be part of the player ' suspension of disbelief they be there and they totally have all the behavior list in the Pokédex but you just never see they Legends Arceus on the other hand show the Pokémon in the wild and they just stand there and wander around a bit they don ' live in the world they have no home they have no behavior they don ' interact with one another they simply exist and wait to be catch or fight this much more than the obvious visual fidelity issue make the world feel lifeless and oddly empty out of battle catch speed up the game to an insane extent if you could catch everything without fight it the game would be over extremely quickly and Game Freak need to not let that happen because of the large number of people out there who equate Time spend with Money Value it seem Game Freak have implement two solution in order to prevent the game ' runtime from be drastically shorten First Pokémon fall into three category friendly skittish and aggressive Friendly Pokémon can be catch out of battle with no special requirement just throw a ball Skittish Pokémon can be catch out of battle as long as they don ' see you first they will run away Aggressive Pokémon can not be catch outside battle whatsoever and must be fight and capture in the traditional manner Game Freak have make MOST Pokémon aggressive they make a super convenient change to the formula and then set thing up to force you through the traditional formula anyway for the most part secondly and far more damningly the Pokédex require multiple catch multiple victorious battle multiple observation of Pokémon move use and other checklist item such as catch without be see before a dex entry for a specific Pokémon will be complete there really be no reason or justification provide for what amount to repetitious busywork it seem obvious that this be another solution to the problem of we make play the game fast and more convenient but we need to keep they play for roughly the same amount of time as before Catching be fast now require a lot more catch instead of just the traditional one and do Battling be controllable now and not at all randomize Require a specific number of battle for each Pokémon so the player have to fight they multiple time anyway and bad virtually everything in the game revolve around dex completion which never get any more interesting or complex over time sidequest ask for complete dex entry outright or for thing you do to complete dex entry the main quest also require dex entry it ' a one note game loop Game Freak could have do much more interesting thing with its good core change make the Pokémon appear to really live in the world require the player to observe and record their behavior what they eat where they live use the Switch as if it be the dex itself similar to how BotW treat the tablet as an actual in game device and permit the player to directly record dex info perhaps with fill in the blank field and a selection of pre write answer option in a game where the dex be so central interesting thing to do with the dex seem like a no brainer Unfortunately Game Freak settle for just make they do the usual stuff but way more the end result be a decidedly repetitive lackluster game I hope Game Freak figure out where it go wrong here as it really isn ' hard to see the hole 
if this have good graphic it would be GOTY it do not get repetitive really nice game 
in an open world like game graphic be one of the main feature it play a very important role it can not and must not be ignore this title sell only because pokemon otherwise a title with such a technical scarcity nobody would have buy it let ' take off the fanboy mask and let ' look well what we have on hand a game that move the foundation and renew these title fun intrigue etc but we want to talk about the game world square hill 2 type of tree copy paste for the whole map zero dungeon 4 cross tunnel with the same texture everywhere undriveable mount camera that leave for its cabbage mountain that change shape as you move away tall grass make with of the strip that rotate with the camera telecameraand I could go on and on 8 for such a title I find it absurd and offensive towards those who put effort and love into create their own game 
one step ahead two behind they could have do just a little more and this could have be the new standard for pokemon game gameplay wise 
while it be refreshing to see pokemon in open environment its ridiculous that people be rave about this game it be one of the bad looking game on switch the world be bland empty and the pokemon just shuffle around and do not feel alive the volume and repetition in catch pokemon lessen your attachment to your team Pokemon be the high grossing video game series ever and we deserve well People be give this a 10 and if a Zelda or mario game be release with this quality and lack of ambition it would get a terrible review new snap and the diamond pearl remake be both big file and it show in the lack of attention to detail in arceus 
good if you be a pokémon fan but if this game be make by another company nobody would play it the gameplay be interesting but it ´ the only thing the story be poor and the tutorial never end 
I have be play Pokemon since Emerald and yes I do like the step that they be go to with this game but out of sheer love for the franchise I just can not ever recommend this game consider how much it cost and the actually quality and quantity you be get I be hope to be able to give a pass to the horrid graphic if the world itself have something compelling to do in it but no what I get be sloppy excuse of mish mash of terrain right now I can ' even bare to finish it the game doesn ' keep I hook especially not with how grindy the progression feel the research part be a great and certainly something most fan want but put it as the only way to progress the story just make it feel like a chore no gamefreak I don ' want to catch this pokemon for 267th time to progress this subpar story and move on to the story it be alright but again that damn research system shouldn ' be the main part just like the pokedex in previous game it should 've just be a side objective that you slowly progress as you play through the game not vice versa now let ' talk about the world if you could even call it that you know what the open world feel like like they spit on my face and say deal with it let I ask everyone else who ' play can you name atleast 5 place on the map and say something interesting about they take away the pokemon roam around and ask yourself be any of the wilderness area memorable the answer be noand now the roaming pokemon what else be there to say they be basic ai that just so happen to look like pokemon I ' not expect a complex simulation of their ecosystem but they didn ' even try to improve on it after SwSh Sword Shield finally I have to reiterate I love Pokemon but rn as thing stand I don ' think gamefreak feel the same love towards it overall the game be a 5 10 there be good idea and at least some hope for a well game in the future but right now Pokemon Legends Arceus feel like an unfinished half assed game with uncooked but great idea do well gamefreak do well unrelated rant about part of the pokemon community like order a steak in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and get raw beef you like steak but the chef didn ' bother to cook it you be disappoint by the result but you see everyone else eat the raw beef just because Ramsay do it you decide to not eat the raw uncooked beef but everyone else in the restaurant glare at you because of it that ' what the community feel like nowadays I ' criticize the game cause I want they to do well I have no ill intention but everyone else feel ok and satisfied with the status quo while demonize those who be actually passionate and love the pokemon game one who want to see it reach it ' full potential 
while many of the late Pokemon game will introduce a few new feature or tweak but retain the same gameplay and story this take it in a whole new direction the gameplay be wildly different and make it feel not like a game you play but a world you be part of Less of a step in the right direction and more of a sprint I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the series and look forward to any future installment 
the good gane of pokemon the shinyhunt its more easy and the open world increíble 
a semi open world pokemon game be the way to go the pokemon company ' lack of affection for the saga be worry this game need at least one more year of development but Pokemon only care about the money they know that it will sell just the same even if the game be an authentic graphic * * * * like this one also the game be very repetitive and kind of boring 
awesome new concept and I have really high hope the story be interesting at first but the game be so grindy and lose a lot of the pokemon charm no cool new landscape bond with pokemon and not that many hidden secret to discover it ' grindy and the visual aren ' good — all the pokemon want to run or fight interesting new direction but overall lose the fun 
all four of the boss be great the way you catch pokemon be amazing in every way Awesome game 
really let down by the gaming community ' inability to give objective review I be excited about this game from the moment I hear about it a year ago I really want to like it but as I watch it go through development I see red flag after red flag the game seem to suffer from lazy open world design syndrome where the illusion of endless opportunity boil down to reveal a game void of meaningful content with redundant and scarce gameplay loop see the Pokémon in the overworld have more control over the trainer and their poke ball these be great idea that get people excite but think about how much be miss look at the legendary open world game like TES GTA and BotW these game have their base gameplay loop sling sword and sorcery steal car but they come together to support epic overarch story guild colorful character impactful decision I have a lot of fun with Pokémon let ' go and a lot of people complain about that I think both the game suffer from a lot of the same problem Hasty development lazy and uninspired UI technical issue we didn ' see in their predecessor but where be the negative review for legend I want to like Arceus but this game clearly didn ' get the budget it would have take to properly pull off this really great idea imagine guild plotline like from TES but you ’re work your way up through gym save Pokémon as a ranger or refine your Pokémon as a breeder imagine colorful character send you on meaningful adventure and become your companion but no we get a super boil down game that feel like one or two year of development work from the team come on gaming community tell I with a straight face this be Pokémon breath of the wild that ' just insult to the team who put together the masterpiece that be botw it ' like say a Honda with a spoiler be the japanese Ferrari smhthat be say I ' optimistic for this franchise go forward the massively positive response this game have see despite its to I at least obvious shortcoming should tip off the game maker that the community be hungry for the type of gameplay that Arceus display I ' maybe pay 30 for this game but 60 no way 
I quite like the game it ' fun I sink 24 hour into it in a few week it just seem under baked I know I ' go to complete the game because I enjoy it but it ' flaw the environment be stale AI be poor pop in be horrible for a game about explore my big complaint be the map there ' no map in the corner and so I find myself constantly open the map up and on top of that you can only place one guide marker at a time it ' a refreshing game it ' not hard at all if that ' what you want but I would recommend it 5 just because it ' good but it could have be so much more I just see a decent base idea with a flawed execution 
the first novelty that give I heaviness be see all those item to be complete for each single Pokémon in the PokéDex Many be repetitive and although it be initially nice to capture they they give I a sense of annoyance you can ' stay there for hour behind pokemon to take they from behind to catch they over and over again I prefer the classic capture method that I already miss while continue it seem to always be in the first area everything be the same from the first to the last especially after 10h you start to feel the weight of the graphic the pasture be full of the same pokémon and after a while you can no long distinguish there isn ' even a tier order or anything like that always talk about order I can ' understand what the tool in my purse or just the Pokédex be quick powerful move despite these facility several time you do not lose gain a turn stand there each time to press to see who will attack that turn Pokémon be not oblige to innovate I do not like the news such as move have to fill in all those item especially because if you do not rise in rank in a situation you can not continue the story the graphic the clutter if it be to innovate the focus must be on creature and the interaction with they above all I don ' want to rank up to get ultraball etc and be able to catch strong pokemon I be limit and force to register pokemon repetitively waste time just because I can not continueost absent except in struggle and in some situation with the powerful move you lose all the beauty of pokemon clash with one move you knock out the pokemon and you finish everything quickly because then people have always complain about the difficulty game freak have decide to get the exp point only at the end of the fight for I it make no sense it just make everything more difficult and frustrating because the KO pokemon do not go up by lv and many will ko 
I wasn ' sure what to make of PL Arceus when it be first announce on the one hand GF and TPC appear to be change up the battle mechanic add real time element on the other hand its poor graphic and empty overworld leave a lot to be desire it be also unclear whether the game would be an experimental one off or an attempt to change evolve the series ' core mechanic as someone who ' play since the very first title but find the late entry to be stale and disappointing I go in with very low expectation Pokemon Legends Arceus ' trailer promise a decent story and while I can attest that the writing receive more focus than usual the presentation frankly suck as there ' still no voice act with most interaction consist of character awkwardly stand talk the real draw be the revamp combat and catch system the change to gameplay while not perfect make Arceus initially far more captivating than its precede game first and most importantly you can aim Poke Balls to interact directly with Pokemon on the field while explore you ’ll be able to easily shuffle who ' next in line to battle as well as send they to harvest material from tree shrub and mineral outcropping essential for craft healing item and Poke Balls many Pokemon will either run or attack your avatar on sight so you ’ve get option dodge like it ' Dark Souls sneak around and try to nab they without be spot ambush with your Pokemon to start a fight lure repel they with food or run away you ’ll also get multiple Pokemon mount to ride across the game ' several open area Combat be tweak in many minor way while you ’ll be dodge occasionally aside from boss you don ' fight Pokemon in real time so the traditional four move turn base core combat remain the game introduce agile and strong variation to attack fast and weak VS strong and slow Best of all your Pokemon ' move can now be easily switch outside of battle make it infinitely more convenient to swap moveset it really open up a lot of possibility you can have your starter be a sweeper in one battle and a defensive mon catch tool in the next Held item no long exist Status effect be tweak with most be weak and they thankfully disappear after each battle these change as well as the limited pool of teachable move make certain build such as dedicated physical and special sweeper far more effective it ’ll be in your interest to get battle do as quickly as possible especially since you ’ll often find yourself fight multiple wild Pokemon at once with just one of your own for the most part the change also help the game to flow smoother since you ’ll be cover a lot of ground in the great outdoor often atop mount Pokemon however due to the kneecapping of potential build owe to the removal of breeding and lack of variety in your foe make fine tuning an afterthought I grow bored of the battle halfway in there be no gym no breeding and very few trainer battle instead you ’ll spend time gathering craft and on the Pokedex this time your dex entry don ' end with just catch and trading you ’re also task with specific battle task you ’ll only need to fulfill ten challenge per Pokemon so while it isn ' daunt it do feel like busywork that bring I to the game ' big weakness the world itself and I don ' just mean the fact that there be limited way to interact with the environment or that the 242 Pokemon be a mixed bag of specie while the Pokemon model be often well animate the day night and weather cycle add variety and the game run smoothly with minimal loading there ' no sugarcoat the fact that the graphic and environment be subpar feature empty world tree texture that would look bad on the GameCube pop in and heavy aliasing a bland color palette temper by muted art direction it ' a testament to the strength of Arceus ' core mechanic that the bland environment lack of trainer battle and unfinished feel of the game don ' completely sink the experience perhaps it ' because my expectation be so low go in but I can safely say that in spite of its many fault Arceus be the most fun I ’ve have with a Pokemon title since the day of the DS it also show that the franchise in general still have potential that may sound like faint praise from someone who have be critical of the mainline franchise for year but I think most fan will appreciate the real time element the easily swappable moveset and the addition to the world building and lore my only hope be that Nintendo be able to build upon what be establish in this title and utilize it to take the franchise forward in a bold new direction rate 4 10 to balance out all the shill 
a nice Pokemon game be wonderful for milk the brand after all it look good but purely in term of gameplay it ' all scheme Nintendo release a Pokemon game without really think about it you don ' have to be creative anymore because it will be buy anyway 
while the story and new mechanic be truly amazing and mark a great progress in this old franchise everything be let down by the terrible engine in the game which bring everything down the amount of detail be terribly low framerate be well below acceptable resolution be low and the game even in dock mode look and play really bad the world be simply empty and still the framerate dip quite often it be really sad because the new story mechanic and the whole idea for the game be great we can ' even blame switch for this state of the game we have the game like BOTW or Xenoblade that have a really well make open world it ' a major disappointment consider that the Pokemon game be always sell like crazy 
after complete the game and spend about 25 hour in it I sadly have to say it be a hard pass on a reply I want to like it I try to like it but the only reason I even beat it at the end be to say I do a lot of small thing overall irritated think out my time play this game that will be excuse cause it be not as buggie as other AAA title I will give it all the credit in the world for be playable but it ' sad be in a age where that be a thing 
I be hope for Pokemon to finally catch up with time but it feel like they only develop a game that should have be release 10 year ago it even far convince I that publisher developer of pokemon game only aim to milk nostalgic player and child who just start their adventure with pokemon minimum amount of effort for maximum amount of profit look like have become the motto for a while now still could enjoy bit and piece but I be fall asleep most of the time 
I try to play Pokemon but I still see a lot of room for improvement I ' look forward to the next one 
Don ' buy it if you really like pokemon and want Game Freak to do well it ' the only way we as consumer can make the difference Don ' get I wrong I ' not say that every thing in there be terrible but we as player deserve well than this for 60 € or what your currency be if you like gameplay loop play Monster Hunter if you like open world play Zelda if you like pokemon battle play BDSP what we have here be nothing to be praise 
man the graphic in this game be bad look like a ps2 game the gameplay be not fun 
as you all already know the graphic be really bad like a unity terrain tutorial look betterit not really open world and you know that be not the bad problemso you have like 5 small area with a hub world but they somehow make this 5 small area really empty and blandbattle system be boringcathe pokemon be not the bad thing ever but it get old after a whilecouldnt get more than 13 hour in before get really boredand if u like it that s fine but il take a break from all the crappy game that have come out the past 9 year 
the map and the graphic be downright ugly and disappointing I think the catch mechanic be a lot of fun but after the first 10 20 hour my enjoyment drop off fast the lack of trainer battle make level up and raise different Pokemon virtually pointless there be some nice quality of life improvement in this game such as the move select and evolution menu and the agile and strong style mechanic be interesting but again the lack of trainer battle make this game have zero replay ability after you beat the main story 
I want a game not an unpaid job look average well than sword shield good for kid I guess if you be desperate 
here be a game that on paper get I excited for a Pokemon game after year and year of the same repeat game with different skin come a new game that try to be different the problem be that each new idea feels cut short and never truly flesh out the visual be boring and flat People seem to confuse graphic with thing like ultra realism or rtx but that be not what I be speak about a game can have simple graphic but still manage to set itself apart and look visually interesting this game need voice act of some kind the lack of voice act just feel low budget and bore even a grunt would bring it up a point in my book at this point the game play be fun and I would have enjoy the open movement to play a big part in the battle I think we be at a point where we can start to move away from the turn base battle final fantasy have a great solution in its remake where it could be toggle on for those who enjoy it but be not force onto the player Combat could be so much more by do it real time heck even just getting rid of the one Pokemon limit when battle would be an improvement it feel like they pick this time period so that they could finally do something different with the Pokemon formula but then chose not lean into it fully and we be leave with half bake new feature that just leave we want more hopefully this game will lead a future where Pokemon game can be something more than just an advertisement to sell merchandise 
the pathfinding work on the map be really painful and I don ' just focus on the graphic come on nintendo the world of Biomutant be more alive 
it ' an ok pokemon game but it ' not a good game the world feel empty graphic be outdated and pretty inconsistent the story and character be weak even for a pokemon game and once the novelty wear off the gameplay loop be really repetitive this game really need more time in development to create a world worth explore and to refine all the new idea but right now this feel like a precursor to a great game and definitely not worth the price tag if you enjoy the game before or have a strong connection to the franchise you will likely enjoy it and appreciate the change but it ' probably not win over new fan hope they actually take the time with the next one and run with the new idea because it could make for a genuinely amazing game 
well than Pokémon Britian but could have be way well there ' a whole lot of useless empty space with nothing around to catch interest look like the environment department take 98 of the texture model budget while the building such look good the character model do need more touch up as lighting reveal the model polygon on occasion or character mouth continously open close like a singing bass on a wall complete the pokedex be tedious busy work now more than ever as completion criterion be random sometimes require 40 + interaction with a single type of Pokémon Models visibly appear disappear when in out of render range Pokémon animation visibly tank to 3 frame at a distance the evolution animation be the good and the music be top notch 
good idea for a game but horrible execution Game be just boring for the most part and story make no sense 
if we be honest in the graphic section it leave a lot to be desire and be even boring and cancine at time the Pokémon Legends arceus I understand that it seem very good because of the new fighting mechanic however they continue to drag certain problem from the sword and shield series I do not deny that the game be fun or that we be face a great game create by Game freak however I could notice how this game be not make with the love and affection that accompany the Pokémon game 
long and boring tutorial poor plot and character 2013 graphic and framerate there be only a good thing about the game it be a Pokemon game 
for a person who have only play Pokémon game for their entire life who be experience an open world game for the first time this be revolutionary this be a solid 100 if you play many franchise or even multi platform the game be mediocre in every way it ' a bunch of good idea terribly execute the game feel poor budget regardless on the Pokémon Company be a 100 billion dollar empire their product doesn ' reflect their power at all if you be just curious to try a Pokémon this will fall just like what it be with no fanaticism and biased thought a mediocre basic and rough game Get Pokémon Sword Shield 
a game that only Pokemon fan would tolerate no other game could be this much of a technical disaster and still garner so much praise only Pokemon Graphics sound design level design npc and more be so undercooked that I would have guess this game be a year away from release the gameplay loop be fun enough go out into the zone and catch Pokemon Level they up evolve they fill out your pokedex the same fun loop that Pokemon be build on but open up to large zone not open world I ' happy that many fan be enjoy this but wow that be where my praise end the graphic be well document as be the bad of any AAA game in recent year it ' hard to overstate how bad they be this be the ugly major release of any ip I can remember there be also no voice over or even the typical JRPG grunt just silence during conversation the open zone level design be a nice change but it be mar by the game ' ugliness not to mention basic fun feature like a follow Pokemon or the ability to look at your newly catch Pokemon ' stat in the field be absent npc be also copy paste across the game which be sad consider there be maybe 100 of they if that I just don ' understand how this game can be celebrate Pokemon fan deserve well there be early access indie game that be well optimize with well technical design than this my last critique be that the first 1 2 hour be incredibly boring but apparently this be normal for Pokemon game I do not recommend this game 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be a fail experiment but a solid and promising begining for a new era of the franchise let ' start with the good thing the new set up team mechanic be pretty good in a way that the moveset be changeable all the time which give you the oportunity to prepare difficult combat Note there be not difficult combat but for the future be way beyond interesting I like the idea of introduce new type of attack strong and agile the concept of the pokemon mission be addictive make the game more enjoyable try to complete the task of your favorite pokemon Capturing be not my favorite mechanic because I rather combat but it ' pretty satisfying and well do bad thing the story and it ' narrative be so dumb in a way that the character be flatter you because you capture a lvl2 pokemon and they couldn ' I mean you where there for 5min and you do what they couldn ' for their entire life it ' just ridiculous another dumb thing be the Professor character how in the hell can be someone a professor if you just can ' study the pokemon what can you teach ignore all of this the story just feel like an anime issekai type of story which be not necessary that bad the game design be so generic pokemon always have a charismatic look and I don ' see nothing about it in this game the tree the town and building etc just look like a generic f2p chinese game I expect more from Pokemon Company the map look pretty damn good though even the music be generic the new roster of pokemon from Hisui despite Arcanine be way worse design than their original form and Arcanine it ' not that he ' well just feel different no online PVP the stat from the pokemon be no long need and that s pitty let ' finish with the more obvious of all of they the game look really bad not only talk about the graphic which be way below from the standard of the Switch console I will not compare it with BOTW a game lauche 4year ago but if you do a massive open world it ' important that the ambientation and the world itself work as a hole in order to get inmerse in it 
thing start off fun and exciting but quickly become redundant and monotone complete the pokedex be overkill and after complete the game you wonder why you actually even bother try to complete any of the side quest give you nothing but a few additional resource the store be a joke you will never actually have to buy a pokeball or potion for the entirety of the gameThe lack of other village or town in the game be pretty horrendous only another village and yet nothing worthwhile to the storyline to do there as other critic have mention the npc be also blatantly empty to I the only worthwhile point to this game be the storyline and even there they could 've cut to the chase at the end instead of add double and triple plot twist complete the game and toss it in my complete game section May or may not take it out for dlc if any in the future but it really feel like dlc should have be part of the game in the first place overall verdict borrow it from a friend complete the story and don ' bother complete the pokedex buy stuff or do side quest they give little to no addition to the game 
look like most reviewer only play the game for 3 4 hour otherwise I can not explain myself all these good ratingsgame look like trash and after a relatively short time everything just repeat 
it ' pretty crazy what Pokemon can get away with they have switch up the formula which imo be definitely for the good however it have be do poorly it look like it be still in development and make by a small company with little income the graphic look so crap there be so few npc Pokemon just sit idle as if they re not actually part of the surround but just artificially place there the gameplay loo 
imagine you be work at GameFreak and they tell you we be go to completely change the formula and give the fan what they have want and then you hear applause and scream of joy but then your boss tell you I know this be a huge moment for we and the fan but you have less than a year to develop this game because we be greedy and love money and you start think about your life choice well this game have prove to I that work at GameFreak be like want to be a prestige restaurant chef and then I end up flip burger at McDonald ' how can you release such a boring repetitive unoriginal and ugly game in 2022 unskippable cutscene awful story awful character clunky movement clunky aim system make my finger hurt for the first time since play on this console for 3 year repetitive gameplay loop collect resource > craft pokéball > catch pokémon repeat and bad of all huge empty map with nothing to do in they how can you build a fake open world game with no activity to do besides catch Pokémon and craft item the most basic craft I have ever see in my entire life make it so empty and run at barely 30 fps in 2022 on a console that have release Xenoblades 2 and botw the only reason I don ' give this game a 0 be because I appreciate immensely the effort to give the franchise a new direction and a breath of fresh although smelly air this be actually a step into the right direction I also love the fact that the Pokémon feel alive and the move animation be actually pretty slick but for I that ' it the game isn ' fun at all Pokémon fan need to stop lower the bar and be amazed at the low effort development this company bring stop let they treat you as if you didn ' deserve more you give they million every year and this be what they do to reward you Screw that man 
absolute garbage how anyone can rate this high than a 5 be beyond I I be already bore after the first 4 hour and never want to play it again I be a pretty decent pokemon fan but this game be so empty and dead and look like I m play and unfinished PS2 game literally no thought be put into the art direction its as if all they do be raise the terrain in random area and splatter on some copy and paste tree and call it a day the gameplay it fun at least and its finally something new and fresh and I believe that they can build upon this and make a well game in the future but this be not it chief 
the ingredient be there but combine in an incredibly lazy low effort way optimistic that they will continue to try new thing but this miss the mark ik polish story and variation in gameplay 
the score above 7 be pure fanboy the texture be terrible the tutorial be very long you have to be 2 meter from a pokemon to see why if not it doesn ' load the sound be break you can beat the game without fight except for 4 fight you can beat pokemon that take 20 level out of you effortlessly the intention be good but they have make a low budget Breath of the wild impact sad on the part of nintendo 
a game that should have look like this at least 10 year ago consider how much money GameFreak be make from the franchise and end up give the fan such a bad game the animation have once again be take over from the 3ds game Ultra Moon and Sword you work through checklist and have very few trainer fight if it be an indie game it would get a 7 out of 10 but this be one of the big franchise in the world 
pro some music the design of some PokemonBad technically unjustifiable Pokemon be lifeless puppet wander in an empty world without any level design devoid of ecosystem unbalanced and unclear combat system banal and redundant story 
bare bone of a game decent gameplay mechanic but surround by ugly graphic and a bland story could be far well and any fan that settle for this it ' not help the franchaise yes praise the good thing of the game the new thing that they have try with the capture mechanic the combat etc but please say the truth it ' an average game at most when you see the full picture let ' not make a battle of 0 ' and 10 ' we can argue about give the game from a 3 to a 5 5 6 rating but anything else it ' just unfounded hate or fanboyism 
no no this could not be a game from 2022 it look like an early Gamecube game at good its horrible looking why do I buy this trash the open world gameplay be nice and battle Pokemon be kinda fun but that s all there be that s good oh and a good size amout of pokemon again this be Nintendo put something out there where ppl play PS4 or PS5 be roll off there chair laugh at this game I love Nintendo to death but this be pretty bad yes its bad 
it would be a pretty solid Nintendo Gamecube game as a Nintendo Switch game it ' offensive to the fan 
Pokemon Legends be an extreme disappointment for I I be super hype for this game as a lifelong Pokemon fan but also as an RPG fan this game fall short of my expectation in several different category firstly the combat feel horrible to I they revamp the stat and combat system for Pokemon Legends but it doesn ' feel good every move hit so hard and you will often lose several Pokemon battle a wild Pokemon you will almost always lose a few when fight an Alpha Pokemon or a Noble Pokemon a lot of people seem to think this make the game more challenging but to I it just make it more frustrating I still never black out or lose my entire party I just have to craft a boatload of revive and potion after each fight in addition to this they remove ability from the game and instead add Agile and strong style move you can use agile to perform and weak attack or strong for the opposite while this seem cool in theory battle rarely ever last long enough to reward use agile style I personally feel like ability make Pokemon more unique and provide for a more interesting combat experience Overall I try to avoid encounter with wild Pokemon and catch they without enter combat if possible secondly the story blow one of the main appeal to most rpg be their story the Witcher Skyrim Horizon Zero Dawn etc all have deep story with plenty of twist and turn that keep you engage the story in Pokemon Legends be extremely vague and offer very little conclusion even upon full completion you be basically a kid who fall through a space time distortion into ancient Sinnoh where Pokemon be go crazy upon completion of the story and the entire pokedex you still haven ' figure out who you be and why you fall through the space time rift to begin with Third call this an open world RPG be laughable the game be extremely linear and you be bind to certain area until you complete the main quest this isn ' like Skyrim Fallout or Breath of the Wild where you can freely go where you please and complete the story how you like there be no meaningful choice involve at all you can explore the area you have unlock to your heart ' content but there aren ' really any side story or anything the world be bland and lack depth there aren ' any cool puzzle or hidden area to discover ultimately this just feel like a different take on the exist Pokemon game it certainly didn ' feel like the revolutionary open world RPG that it be hype up to be lastly I try not to judge this game too harshly off of graphic and performance but unfortunately it be impossible to overlook that aspect of the game this game play and look bad than Skyrim a 2011 game there be FPS drop that make the game laggy and feel bad regardless of whether you play handheld or dock I know the Switch isn ' a very powerful system but it sure run Breath of the Wild a heck of a lot well overalll I think Pokemon Legends be a cool idea with awful execution while it be enjoyable at time especially in the beginning do the same thing over and over get old pretty fast this game feel close to be something awesome but fall short in way too many crucial area for I to warrant give it more than a 3 or a 4 at well unfortunately due to the shockingly good review this game have get so far I don ' think Game Freak or TPC will make effort to improve on these area in the future and Pokemon will continue to go downhill as a franchise 
leave aside the pitiful graphic it look like a game make without desire unfortunately disappoint in what will be the first pokemon game that I will not complete 
it ' fun in the short term but it doesn ' have much in the way of replayability or even story despite the fact that it ' suppose to be narrative drive Most of the game be catch Pokémon until it ' time for you to do the same repetitive task of calm the angry lord Pokémon Pokémon be no stranger to repetition but it ' less challenging than the Pokémon Gyms in previous game those at least have a few trainer each different puzzle to solve and Gym Leaders weren ' hard to beat but if you weren ' prepare you could lose or just barely win the lord Pokémon be much easy to beat than Gym Leaders and it ' a much more tedious task you just throw balm battle throw balm battle again and throw balm or you can skip the battle completely and just throw balm even Dialga and Palkia can be cheese by just throw balm and they be some of the final boss of the game there ' a huge lack of trainer battle in the game you be lucky to see one every half hour I ' say it ' close to one an hour unless you be at the few segment in the game where you be force into back to back battle there ' no post game facility like virtually every other main series game after Crystal and there be about 240 Pokémon so very few to choose from in regard to team building on subsequent playthrough if you can actually bring yourself to replay the game you will likely end up use the same Pokémon because there be so few encounter in the first 5 or so area there be a decent number of side quest or Requests as the game call they to differentiate from the main quest or mission but most of they be simple fetch quest bring an NPC number of item show they a certain Pokémon or Pokédex entry etc and there ' virtually no multiplayer besides trading despite every other main series game have player vs player battle which never detract from the single player experience the world be also full of barren field or mountain that have maybe 2 or 3 Pokémon on screen at good 99 of the time which be inexcusable because the area be relatively small compare to other open world game I ' use that term loosely for this game other game of this nature you will find settlement or structure with character who will give you quest or you can explore a dungeon no such luck here you will just keep walk see the same Pokémon and plant over and over again the game be mediocre at well bad but not terrible at bad I know bad game because I have play the two Worlds game and sonic 06 I really want to like the game and hope it would be good but I be thoroughly let down Pokémon Sword and Shield and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and shine Pearl be mile ahead of this game in term of content replayability and follow the concept of the series as a whole 
it ' a common point that people make that graphics don ' matter it ' all about style and gameplay well in this game you don ' have visual quality but it also look artistically defunct the copy paste house in the small village thing only a few tree space out unnaturally use the same model and size the shiny flat texture on the ground and people act like move in a somewhat open space be a huge innovation when that have be a standard thing for more than a decade they be on a point where they can say it ' a pokemon game people will buy anything as long as it ' a Pokemon game 
quick and easy review the story be not bad at all empty and lifeless world Bad physics texture and framerate rough control terrible typography the worst open world in an AAA you have to be a hardcore fan to like it 
the first 3 hour have be awesome but the exact same procedure in ugly environment which be repeat in the next 4 area be the bad the story be bad as well as the gameplay or the animation of the figure actually its pokemon stadium with well graphic a shame for this game studio 
this game look like a beta it be not finish the technical section be a disaster it have bug it be very flat and the texture be not attractive at all for all the money and support the company receive it ' a game make with very little desire the new mechanic aren ' much and the combat lack any appeal we need the company to get its act together or this saga will go to waste very disappointed 
this game have about an hour of tutorial if you scream through they a ton of time of useless dialogue and the bad offense of all MMO mechanic use a move time catch this pokemon time kill this pokemon time you have to do this to progress in the game if you buy this game understand that it ' a money waste timesink with some cool mechanic sprinkle in to remind you of what could 've be 
Pokemon Legends Arceus be more of a tech demo that experience with new mechanic and quality of life feature for the pokemon franchise than it be a fully fledge AAA title PLA ' main draw be that it attempt to shakeup the pokemon formula by modernize the pokemon experience to more closely match what pokemon catch would be like in the real world and how it be depict in the anime series there be clearly some effort put forth here in execute this new formula but just like almost every other recent iteration of pokemon there be obvious sign of neglect and corner cut the most obvious sign of neglect come from its lackluster visual Graphics aren ' everything sure but in a semi open world game where explore the environment and catch pokemon be the main draw how the world look be an important aspect of the overall experience not only be the graphic sub par when compare to other title on the same console it doesn ' even match the graphical quality of game from 5 + year ago now if sub par graphic be use to make up for hinderance due to performance that can be more understandable but that be not the case here PLA have much less take place on screen at any give time than many other open world game and it ' also not technically an open world game as each individual area you explore be a restricted sub set of the overall world base on what mission objective be choose from the Town Hub which be also the only town you will be visit give the restrictive nature of the open world and its sub par graphic it could still look well if simply more be take place on screen for example if there be more tree more grass more pokemon etc even if the texture look the way they do there would be well immersion overall instead we get poor graphic a limited world and barren empty environment all of that be say this unfortunately doesn ' equate to well performance the game still suffer from performance issue and pop in Aside from visual and performance the game itself have a repetitive gameplay loop there be no dungeon in PLA no real puzzle no interesting cave there be pokemon and there be more pokemon and your only job be to throw ball at they and or fight they not have iv ev breed competitive battle hold item etc remove a huge aspect of replay ability and purpose from the game not have any interesting nice look environment to explore no puzzle and no real challenge aside from make your character roll to the side make this overall experience very lack luster some would probably say that only hardcore pokemon fan would like this game but I disagree I think there be plenty of hardcore pokemon fan who simply recognize this game flaw and be able to acknowledge this be not the definitive edition of pokemon or what we all want if you like simply catch pokemon reading lot of dialogue explore empty world not have any real motivation or purpose aside from complete checklist then you will likely enjoy this game for everyone else you be go to be disappoint I would assume though that the majority of the more critical gamer and pokemon fan already know this I give GameFreak credit for try something new but this be not the kind of pokemon experience I ultimately want it ' scratch the surface it ' get there so to speak but it ' still lack a lot of charm and polish give that this game have I believe only be develop for roughly a year or so what they have manage to achieve in that time isn ' bad necessarily but to call this a AAA Nintendo Switch title and to charge full price for it be disappointing again if go back on the visual and limit the explorable world to small sub set at a time be for performance reason they didn ' achieve their goal the world be a bland uneventful empty barren place there be pokemon in it so there ' that but after you hide in a bush a few time dodge roll some attack and throw a few pokeball around you have literally experience the entirety of this game there be a story sure but it ' somewhat irrelevant and be largely just tedious and not immersive enough give the state the rest of the game be in now maybe GameFreak will be able to use this Tech Demo as a starting point to create future title and maybe in do so we can expect hope for more polish in the future but the point here be that PLA doesn ' really add all that much to the pokemon franchise and the overall experience it offer be very lackluster and generic I think part of the reason PLA be get as much praise as it have be due to the fact that pokemon fan be literally starve for innovation come from the 1 1 remake that be Brilliant Diamond and shine Pearl it make PLA look revolutionary Dodge rolling and open world exploration be not new idea 
it ' interesting and good that Gamefreak finally decide to innovate but the world be dead and look very ugly art style of the world doesn ' match that of the character building and Pokemon whose bright idea be it to create a realistic looking ground and grass with cartoon character fill in the world make no sense art direction be horrible want more evidence Unity free asset store water World be empty nothing happen in it it use to be that Open World game carry with they some feeling of prestige there be always something to do in it and the world be fill to the brim with content this game be the opposite and feel like a student project completely empty and void of any interaction or variety in nature you literally can not do anything 
the Noble Arcenine make I hate this game how in the world could they even consider this be good how be I suppose to avoid arcenine the space be so tiny 
the exploration be really bad to the point of unforgivable traveling through the world be just not fun since it ' hard to press run button why not like other game and there be too many vehicle for the mode of travel with the ill design UI to switch between they also the company really don ' know how encourage player by place good fast travel spot like there be no fast travel before boss or important battle so you can ' adjust team or select item right there and try again so good luck run around the world again and again with the bad experience on the other hand the combat system be super screw the 3 on 1 be totally cheat like they don ' know how balance the difficulty for a fair 1 on 1 combat so hey let just * * * * up the player by let opponent throw 3 pokemon out at once > 
graphic be awful there be no excuse for have graphic player animation bad than windwaker a gamecube game it ' close but far away thing look far far bad in pokemon legend can ' battle friend this on it ' own be insane Removed hold item and ability from pokemon absolutely dumbe down system getting rid of iv be fine but this be rediculous People ' standard for pokemon game be way too low I don ' know how you can play the game and see grass and tree not display from 30 foot away generally look bad than gamecube wii game also just pop into existence when you get close and fly animation of pokemon go at 2fps off in the distance while look at your character run like they poope themselves and say it ' acceptable remember that breath of the wild be make for the WII U and think of how that look I ' sure part of it be they use the ancient engine they use for pokemon and sun moon on the 3ds but they still have responsibility for make the choice to use an abysmal in house engine 
have to come here and rate this I think I would give the game a try give it ' a slight change in formula and Pokémon game be criminally lazy conservative repetitive rip off no good just no good it make my mind hurt see so many ' critic ' aka YouTubers who be afraid of lose their access to early copy brainwash super fan bribe corrupt gaming media outlet rate this game so highly it suck I ' not even go to focus on the graphic but if you think they be acceptable in any way you have no standard in life this be a console that run the Witcher 3 botw comparison really hold merit in this department the gameplay though blimey I just can ' fathom how fan be satisfied with this janky mess of gameplay it ' like one giant wild area from SW SH in term of be empty and devoid of any interest except for the Pokémon themselves the battle have a new gimmick that barely matter or be completely break it ' the same rock paper scissor fare with crap animation the story be absolute garbage surely there have to be a point where even the young kid that seemingly seem to be the audience that hold this series back get sick of the narrative that they trot out in 2022 we still have character just stand there and wave their hand like character from a 20 + year old ps2 JRPG expose about nonsense whilst everyone stand around awkwardly no one have care about a Pokémon story for decade why be there soooo much talk in this game I can tell you why to pad it out and make it long Boss battle be lame who think throw infinite magic food bag be an inspire choice that plus half bake dark soul roll dodge yuck if you ’re a player who really really like switch your brain off and complete a pokédex I can see the appeal but it ' just soooo bad awful graphic and frame rate awful story bland repetitive gameplay if it didn ' have the Pokémon label it would be laugh into oblivion why just why would you invest your time play this game and not amazing game like God of War or Disco Elysium or heck if you ’re a kid botw or Mario Odyssey if you ’ve complete all the great game like these maybe go out to the park instead just anything but this junk Start be sensible with your money so that this franchise with so much potential can actually make some stride forward 
Don ' know where all the good review come from be the expectation already this low Gameplay so first off the first hour of the game be great New Experiences nice idea and the whole setting be great but after the first hour this game be just a grind everything be repetitive and it get boring World the world be just bore no mystery nothing to really explore besides this the graphic be awful the city be all just copy and paste and the pokemon in the world be act like robot also be the game on the technical level like a N64 game bad animation bad rendering so let sum it up Pokemon be finally progress but not nearly enough this game would be okay for like 30 but not as a full price title of course some player will have fun with the game and they like to just grind the same thing over and over again but this game be far away from be good we shouldn ' forget that this be not an Indie Game even if it look like one this game be from GameFreak and its one of the most profitable franchise of the industry so I just recommend everyone to wait for a massive price drop have fun stay safe 
core gameplay loop be run from one resource node to the next while capture each pokemon at least half a dozen time sometimes after stuff their ass with berry first sometimes after throw ball of mud sometimes do the same but stealthily I don ' know who this appeal to but it ' not I the zone be also void of any landmark or point of interest each zone be just a handful of vaguely different biome litter with material to gather and pokemon to catch it ' basically a few different wild area zone and frankly the DLC wild area in SWSH be more interesting than these different pokemon specie behave like each other you get hostile pokemon that seem to spot you from way far than you can even lock on tho they you get skittish pokemon that run away and despawn when they spot you and you get neutral pokemon that don ' give a sh * but that ' the extent of variation in pokemon behavior the boss fight be ridiculously easy and the AI be so basic it can get itself stick in level geometry there be no way you will get hit by the telegraph attack pattern more than once side quest be mostly fetch quest there be literal hour worth of dialogue none of it voice act you will probably mash through most of it scale through the story be a bit wonky there isn ' much of a reason to put effort into your team when whatever the next zone offer be usually strong and high level anyway or you could just bruteforce capture alpha and be way overpower to anything you will currently face battle mechanic have be heavily bastardize for this game ATB turn order turn order mean turn be no long take simultaneously result in situation where you may find yourself in a unfavorable matchup against a much fast pokemon and you don ' even get the chance to switch out before the enemy take one or more turn the game be miss like 70 + of move and the remain move have be simplify to fit the battle system the list of miss battle feature continue there be no priority move ability hold item weather control terrain hazard speed control multitarget move and more move that alter attack or defense now affect both physical and special stat change be now limited to a single stage and they only last for a few turn which be an odd change for sure Status can also now be overridden by another there be no pvp battle but you wouldn ' want they with these battle mechanic anyway there be some good quality of life change like the ability to swap out learn move on the go instead of have to visit the move reminder on the other hand we have lose mobile access to PC and we can ' fast travel between zone first you must return to base camp load into town leave the gate again load into the zone and then move to your location because just fly directly to any point of interest like in any other pokemon game would have be way too convenient the game be pretty poor look on a technical level and the artstyle be inconsistent which be a shame if the game stick to the artstyle it could have look decent Soundscape be also pretty barren and the sparse use of background music doesn ' help to hide it PLA be different I can respect that but it ' also in a lot of way just straight up bad than previous pokemon game and it doesn ' stand on its own as a openworld esque rpg either if you want to observe pokemon play snap if you want to battle pokemon play SWSH if you want a open world RPG play BotW PLA have some aspect of they all but do it very poorly 
how do you defend a game of this quality the Pokémon franchise be one of the most profitable and people keep justify Game Freak for this garbage I ' glad they bring something new but the quality be really poor it ' about time everyone let they know 
pokemon deliver once again a sub par product that feel as clunky as it be uninspired it hide itself under the veil of be open world but in reality it ' nothing more than a series of block entry and constant hand holding set in a large map hell it ' not even possible to get out of the main village you hit an invisible wall you have to warp with the map to another point to change area open world my @ the player be once again treat as someone who can ' grasp the simple gameplay concept yet the menuing be extremely convoluted you get interrupt constantly by instruction direction and obligatory task to perform this be not a game it ' a tour set on rail I will end this by say it also have the bad graphic we have see in the last 5 6 year it ' not even worth the previous generation of Nintendo console it would barely be acceptable for a Gamecube title Pokemon must be laugh hard to have so many blind dedicated fan that will buy every kind of minimal effort they be willing to shove down their throat at full price it ' unfathomable to I that some people dare to give this game score of 9 or 10 Don ' they have any standard 
2 3 cool gameplay mechanic but an ugly game 20 year late technically infamous an inconsistent framerate an empty game repetitive and boring quest a badly write scenario and the least good music from the license it ' good to want to renew the license and congratulation for take the risk but nothing be go well 
the game might be great but these graphic make I puke Mario 64 look more pleasing in my eye it ' like a beta fan make game make by 1 person 
repetitive mechanic empty scenario give the feeling of a dead space short draw distance provoke popping and poor graphic that will undermine the overall experience I can not beleive one of the most profitable ip ever be not able to pull off a mechanic revamp and move to 3d time to say goodbye to GameFreak 
just retch the battle system be the bad since the early generation and nothing be explain at all Wild Pokemon that be 15 level low than my party will randomly take turn after turn after turn and kill I before I get to act during a battle the craft mechanic be bad the area be too big without convenient traversal the pokedex filling be really boring and assume you will catch the same Pokemon again and again and again I don ' want to catch the same Pokemon again I want to catch new one but I ' stick see the same 4 5 Pokemon over and over as I throw Pokeballs at bidoof try to fill up a meter just play the mainline generation 8 game instead if you want a Pokemon experience on the Switch those be much well 
low effort slop from the high grossing franchise in the world play and look like a unity asset flip 
after a few hour the same man again and again feel like a bad mobile phone game it ' not the full price 
it be just a disrespect to player to deal with such an outdated graphic if GF doesn ' know how to develop a 3d game they should stick to 2D the game itself could be a nice spin off from the main series more focused on the grinding and lore the main problem with it be that the open map world feel empty you can ' interact with anything but the small number of pokemon you find along the way overall it kill the immersion and make you feel bored pretty soon 
legend Arceus be a pretty disappointing game the game have solid mechanic but they have a lot of problem and it ' pretty likely they will be forget for next game it ' unacceptable how the game actually limit the player in simple thing like swim which be a human capability I get that be help by Pokémon for every simple task be something that come all the way from 1st gen Pokémon game but this game seem like the perfect opportunity to change that make the player interact in more way with world the player be in make exploration and catch Pokémon more enjoyable my next point the Pokémon battle be the same trailer hype a lot of people by show new refreshing battle mechanic make it look like it be go to be more than just move the stick and press the a button that before see the reality once again you be limited to a pretty repetitive turn base combat and once again I can see why people actually defend this because that be something that well have be in Pokémon game since the very beginning but I think I can speak for a lot of player when I say I would have like to see and play with a different battle style Graphic wise this be mediocre I can ' see why people actually say it doesn ' matter or actually say it be Nintendo ' hardware fault just take a look at botw or some pretty heavy port like Doom Doom Eternal the Witcher 3 seeing forest with the bare minimung account of tree be disappointing and it affect immersion some area look plain with almost no Pokémon to be see until they pop out of nowhere and no I don ' say this game need Ray Tracing or 4 k texture but as I say just take botw that game look much more solid in graphic once again gamefreak reuse 3ds Pokémon model those that have come all the way from XY and now they can ' justify it again say they want to make Pokémon look well because they be lack animation in the world aside from walk swimming or move the 3d model with no additional animation from the ground to a tree that until the Pokémon disappear this game have less Pokémon than Sword Shield and that be shameful this be the perfect game to add voice acting and I can ' see why they can ' do it it could save immersion make the game more enjoyable and actually help convey the emotion of the character but once again they didn ' make the game feel plain literally waste somewhat of a decent story the game be try to tell a lot of game even f2p game have high quality voice act Nintendo Switch have show to be capable of more than this stuttery mess and I can ' believe this game take all of Gamefreak ' attention make BDSP as bad as they be these two recent Pokémon game have make I see that anual release may not be the way to go if we want to see decent quality again in Pokémon game 
I honestly really dislike legend of Arceus and I think I ' just do with mainline Pokémon for a while aside from the technical issue that we all know would be come the game just isn ' fun the catch get really boring for I after a while the weak mon just go in and it feel like a chore to battle everything else at some point it feel like why be I just fight these Pokémon there ' no reason my ultra or great ball shouldn ' just be able to deal with this which leave I wonder why I be bother to even engage in the dex the game be also horribly unbalanced with your ability to catch alpha Pokémon if you catch one then you basically sweep till the next power up then you sweep again Rinse and repeat the alpha Pokémon be so far ahead of everybody and everyone else it make the game a massive breeze sure you can self inflict rule to not catch they but honestly it shouldn ' have even be an option the mon offer good enough reward defeat they they should have be uncatchable mini boss the pokedex honestly feel like pad I ' glad its more involved don ' get I wrong its an improvement but the option to go far than research level 10 be nothing more than an excuse to get you to play the game more it doesn ' offer anything substantial and nothing you can ' get go well below research level 10 on every Pokémon in a give zone now instead of simply complete the dex the player for true completion must watch a magicarp use splash 100 time watch the tackle ember fire wheel and almost every other move ' animation dozen if not hundred of time you must catch every Pokémon a minimum of 15 25 time for many more because you need to catch they while they be unaware of you watch Pokémon eat food who know how many time beat Pokémon with a certain type of move a ton of time which add to the problem of see repeat animation and this be far bad than other Pokémon game because you can ' disable battle animation and its require to beat the game the world be probably the bad part of the game I ' not talk about the look although I also dislike the art style but the actual play world be just bad its so empty there be nothing to do in each zone other than catch Pokémon nothing to look at other than Mt Coronet nothing in the world to interact with that ' fun there should be more to do than resource gather or catch I want to have fun thing to do while I ' engage in the main game it feel like a parre down version of what it could and honestly should be every zone feel the same while yes one zone be swampy another be cold and one be the sea they feel the same to explore the only reason I remember difference between the zone be because its so fresh in my mind in a few month its go to all blend together if I recall correctly there be a pathway in the first zone that go up and to the left might have be the 3rd and that reappear in the snowy zone not a pathway go up and to the left the exact same pathway it have the same side same slope same geometry same everything the art also look bad I don ' mean graphically I don ' care how it look graphically I mean the art style the game be bland boring and really uninspired its clear they be try for ancient japanese art but it doesn ' translate to the game at all compare to other game on the swtich with more inventive art style and other Pokémon game like unite or xd tournament the game just feel like a smear of brown with some green and blue mix in the fan make stuff look well than the actual game I honestly think it should have look like the end of the reveal trailer that would have be fantastic the character be all also super bland its the same issue with the zone in a few month they be go to blend together again I ' not expect a story or character in Pokémon akin to xenoblade but I be expect something more especially since this Pokémon game be the most story and character drive game since gen 5 I can honestly say I will remember gen 6 character well than these one and its because they have distinctive design the game do improve on the pc mass release move see the true size of Pokémon on the overworld and evolution I think all of those should stay I like those I also enjoy the boss fight the main draw for I be interact with Pokémon in the overworld and they be a fun way of do that while also show the destructive might of Pokémon and show how truly dangerous they be the final thing I really enjoy be the time the game be set in learn about Pokémon with everyone else and watch as people be afraid because of how little they understand about Pokémon be a really fun thing to experience I just wish the rest of the game be as good as that 
lack of polish and horrible graphic don ' make up for a few minor gimmick the game be still year behind 
the absolute minimum a review with Pokemon Legends Arceus Gamefreak have create a game that be on the one hand love and praise to heaven and on the other hand objektively critisese to bare bone but how be this even possible Wouldn ' a really good game be critisese only by hater without any foundational and objektive reasoning Pokemon Legends Arceus try to be and be very different from your classic Pokemon game the change in gameplay be refreshing and it ' clear that Gamefreak finally push Pokemon to new ground the gameplay be very different and very pleasing you can through a Pokeball to a Pokemon and catch it while you be already on your way to a tree with fruit on it and you trough a ball to the tree and your Pokemon collect the fruit then you have different map where you go to do quest like in the Monster Hunter game this concept on it ' own be very nice and can be quite adicte the story be also quite interesting you get to know the beginning of the Sinnoh area where only settler exist and city be yet to build however this where the negative come in 1 grafic Artstyle Tech High and grafic be by all mean no necessity but what Gamefreak deliver here be a disgrace a punch into the gamer face and eye the world be empty there literally be 3 4 type of different tree designe that where just copy paste like in a map editor the texture be muddy low re edgy polygonal some designe unironically look like they copy they from an N64 game tree look at the god damn lava like they didn ' allow the designer to give it texture and make it look like actual lava and not pumpkin soup 60 FPS be also no requirement for a game but somewhat stable 30 FPS like in breath of the wild Xenoblade Chronicles game or Monster Hunter Rise should be the expectable especially from a BILLION Dollar company that own the big and most successfull franchise of all time the framerate constantly be below 30 and in some area the lag be madden Breath of the wild on the WiiU be smooth as * * * * in comparison it baffle my mind how review credit the game to be technically faultless 2 Pokemon and Charcters from a game that want ' you to explore a world full of animal Pokemon that want ' you to study they and build the pokedex you could expect that they interact with each other or have some kind of behaviour but no nothing the Pokemon just stand there and go from point a to point without a reason the don ' yawn scratch their ear scream at ech other play around eat grass fruit insect smell etc there be no Evoli cuddle with another or Starly build a nest they be lifeless creature they could very well scarecrow that be mechanically move between point a and the Characters in this game have like no gesture the head look like a robot when the look from one person to another eye don ' seem to move at all apart from the eyelid and in century of RPG developement earn billion and billion of usd Pokemon have still no voice act if they wouldn ' have an Anime where they could borrow actor from for their OWN FRANCHSIE also why the hell can ' we fly UPWARDS 3 Quests and progression the quest repetitive boring and uninspired it ' like Gamefreak think of a way to artificially increase the length of the game they send you from point a to point to talk to someone just to be send back to point a and this feel like they want you to spend time with walk around between speechbubble because they just haven ' thought of enough content all in all the game be obviously rush and need at least a year if not two to really be worth a full prized AAA game from probably the most wealthy gaming company in the world every other independent devstudio could have do game that look appeal to the eye implement animation to pokemon and character think of actual quest and a well way to fill the pokedex kill or catch 25 of this pokemon to get the pokedexentry this game didn ' even try to be good to make money because the pokemon company know from the very beginning that it will print they million and million of lovely fresh and green usd they didn ' even try to hide tha fact that they didn ' spend much money on the development with good visual like EA do Pokemon Legends Arceus be the result of a company who only want ' our money because they already have build up their reputation with the first 6 generation of Pokemon game the anime and merchandise they know that they only have to do one thing to be able to make more money with Pokemon TM the absolute minimum and even less than that 
this game be such a let down so much so that I submit my first review to metacritic I will say I have love pokemon since red blue and even though this be a step in the right direction I be not go to congratulate they for innovate 15 year too late TLDR Grindy not great look handholdy fetch quest that be detach from the idea of you care for the pokemon you catch the game I will assume the game start at a score of 10 and we can see how it progress shall we firstly the game put you on rail for 2 hour in an unskippable tutorial that start and stop every 5 second to do another cutscene and you can ' turn off the waypoint marker cause you know who like exploration and figure thing out 2 point the grind be unbelievable and it require you to grind to grind endlessly to progress between area so an arbitrary grind gate instead of a challenge you have to overcome if that wasn ' bad enough they have somehow get the idea that catch 1000 identical pokemon be exciting and wholesome it ' not and never will be 3 point boss battle be all the same use some weird tps system where you throw bag at they and have to dodge just at the right time so now we be skip pokemon battle entirely 1 point dialogue have non option until you choose the right option if there be only 1 option don ' pretend like I have 2 1 point the world feel and look plastic like this be an nintendo only developer that have access to reach out to botw team there be no excuse to look this shoddy Furthermore traversal in the environment be quickly eliminate with uncontextual fast travel and a steed that ride the entire map where ever you be in < 1min 1 point everything you do in the game be a fetch quest which as per my last point be trivialize 1 point and don ' get I start on what a disgrace this be for the pokemon music 
the game be very ugly even compare to other game release on the same console the Pokemon animation and sound effect be poor the story and battle be boring and the tutorial be too slow it take more than an hour to start play there be no musicIt look like an alpha 
this might be the most visually displease game I have ever play and I don ' even care for graphic the gameplay loop be also very repetitive and grindy 
it have improvement compare to SwSh but overall still a boring game Map be very empty zero fun for explore the map this game ask you to repeatedly catch Pokémon which be no fine and tiring 
I really really really can ' understand how people can give 10 point to a substandard game this game look feel sound and play bad than game that come out 15 year ago it may be kind of a new start for the franchise I be a huge fan or at least I be but the grafic be a disaster the controll be bad there be no voice act sound affect be lazy make animation be rediculously bad ore not exist please be honest and compare it with game like God of War 4 the last of we RDR2 etc they be today 10 point standard or even compare it with the level of other Nintendo game Breath of the Wild Mario Odyssey Mario Galaxy Luigis Mansion Pokemon become Nintendo ' bad game by far and this game be the big impudence of they all 
legend Arceus be just incredibly ugly in addition so much be not ideally think through and be boring and repetitive I just don ' know how an establish company like GameFreak have so little attention to detail I just miss it in too many place no without I 
this be a rough draft of what could be the future of the good game in the series Exciting for the first couple of hour but after that it just start to get repetitive and the dull and empty environment only hurt it far the problem be that the main objective be to catch Pokémon over and over and over again the same Pokémon we ’ve be catch for the past two decade with some slight variation there ' barely anything new new this time you ’re force to do this because you must complete the Pokédex Pokémon battle take a back seat here there be no build up in story with Pokémon gym be absent to entice you to level up your favorite Pokémon this game be basically Pokémon GO on steroid catch a bunch of Pokémon to fill up your pokédex and that ' basically it the story Pokémon battle and the over world take a massive downgrade in this half bake sorta new entry that leave too much to be desire 
this be a shell of a game for a company that make a billion dollar a year this be unacceptable no online battle or PVP in 2022 no trainer no gym no elite four no town just a little uninteresting village graphic that be very mediocre at well mostly empty biome which lack variety and show laziness in design side quest that give you no incentive to play they that only reward you with little item like potion or Candy which you can get without they hardly any npc very little music hardly any expression in the character face what be they think 
one point for the TryAs we know Pokémon the game be full of handholding at the beginning who think that sun and moon have a long tutorial hasn ' play this after an hour you can finally play without getting interrupt by every 5 second then you encounter the endless loop of Gameplay which be catch catch catch do these and with luck it be the right exemplary you need and you can continue to the next area of the game it ' a drawing after number and you walk from one marker to the next if that ' fun for you cool we not talk about the graphic even that deserve a 0 so yeah story suck as it make no sense they get electric light and phone even tho it play hundred of year ago the plot be stupid the gameplay be boring and the graphic be bad than a 2005 game there you get your Game I will never buy anything from Gamefreak again 
this time Game Freak decide to laugh on the face of everyone just like every other time but with an extra of sell smoke we all have see the poor graphic and all the mechanical problem of the game but I have never expect that they would not even use a single braincell to think about world design the town be completely blocky undetailed and ugly simple to the spine the world be absolute emptiness there ' nothing to do besides the main mechanic of the game throw ball an entire premise of an hostile world and how human start to get along with pokemon throw onto the ground and spit on because of lazyness I can ' believe how its worldbuilding make absolute nonsense while be so basic and poor inside the little thing they do they do wrong it ' formidable I don ' give it a 0 because the HUD be fine and capture in real time aswell be able to move while be in battle be fun and a good integration in Pokémon game but even this be totally waste because leave the mechanic there and not explore it far it become repetitive and just a scourge oh I just remember the linear cave and the white pixel on dark area maybe I should give it a 0 
bad graphic bad game play the game be unfinished and need so much polishing we be talk about game freak and Pokemon the state at which this game have be release be just unacceptable 
at its core it be a singleplayer game with creature to tame and fight as you explore the world to ultimately complete your catalogue of creature and unite the people in this game it be an ambitious undertaking consider this be come from a developer that have put content first over graphic and story in their previous game the issue come from the simple fact that it doesn ' accomplish its own goal it be a much wide scale game with little to do the general gist of the game be to catch and collect all the pokemon of a region before move on to the next to repeat it again it become repetitve very quickly and stop be enjoyable after a few hour the lack of variety in its creature really kill the momentum the first few hour of free roaming give you not to mention its well by its own standard story the npc seem more fleshed out than evr but the series from the very beginning have have a low standard and that s what bother I the most I wouldn ' be laud a developer for do the bare minimum less developer do every time they release a new game they take a step in the right direction do not get I wrong but to veer from their own formulaic game just to give we a barebone look of what pokemon should have be when it come to console just drive the point home that the series have go on a downward spiral for quite some time this reek of a demo of qhat they could be capable of if they actually try I m talk about voice acre new pokemon region actual cave and dungeon to traverse landmark to see and people to find and give quest this feel like a prototype to something truly great and until that come I can not say I like this game 
the actual 8 3 be too much for this my real rate be 5 9 nice game but orrible graphic and my aspettative about the company be high than this result 
this game be good on paper as most people say but the graphic be really lackluster I be not ask cut edge graphic and ultra realism no Breath of the Wild manage to have a beautiful world without get ultra realism the game be repetitive and sometimes just fall flat there be too many dialogue without end and sometimes there be no sound in the game there be no special sound effect for bird or the wind etc I mean there be some but they be so rare that it doesn ' feel like a world it feel like a draft videogame this be a fake openworld with only a few region the npc feel clone there be no voiceover the music lack variety I be expect more from a franchise that have have billion from game where they have only do minor change the change in Arceus be welcome for the most part but they need to be flesh out to be more detailed and finish it ' just a good first draft not a finished game specially for 60 € 
the game be make on the idea that have be make by may fan more than 10 year ago the graphic be bad than 20yo game 
really disappointed about gamefreak they make bad game since year and they doesn ' care they always do the bare minimum and never listen to player the universe have nothing natural it ' too robotic the pokemon move erratically they wander lifeless no ecology no wildlife or anything the devs just create a map and put pokemon here and there and I don ' even speak about the graphic 
this be the good Pokemon game I have ever play my first pokemon game be Red and Blue and see the evolution be amazing 
sound good it have the bad graphical quality of the last decade an empty world with new mechanic that add absolutely nothing in short the IP that generate the most money in the industry laugh in your face once again 
People be suckere into buy an unity asset flip game market as AAA game 
I ' shock that the developer didn ' continue the Pokemon tradition by cut the game in half and sell it separately in a pathetic attempt at make player pay more than 60 I be also surprised that even at their most generous moment the developer still manage to be more greedy than some of the most greediest developer in the video game industry the greedy developer be charge 60 for a game that look like it be make for mobile it doesn ' even have the AAA quality to justify the 60 price tag the graphic be a joke the texture be garbage when I look at some of the rock texture it literally look like it be port from a Game Cube game that be embarrass for a 2022 60 game the animation be garbage the running animation be cringeworthy the rain effect look laughable there be nothing to do in the open world just an empty world full of plant rock and empty hill that be so boring to explore for goodness sake why doesn ' this video game series still have any voice act Unbelievable that there be still 60 game with no voice act in 2022 the developer be too cheap to pay for voice actor this outrageous greed make EA and Rockstar look like saint in comparison at least they put voice act in their 60 game speak of voice act the voice act of the animal sound like they be do by the developer themselves in a pathetic attempt at keep the budget low for this game the physic be beyond horrible especially the water physics the story be trash the combat be boring and repetitive when I pay 60 I expect a combat system with depth and detail all the developer do in this game be put pretty light during every move to give player the illusion that the game be fun none of that be fun for I the soundtrack be terrible there be no multiplayer so once you beat the story there be not a reason to touch this game again charge 60 for a game with no replay value be a cash grab all you can do be trade Pokemon with your friend the developer be too cheap and lazy to allow we to have Pokemon battle with our friend I don ' recommend this game at all unless you want to support laziness if you ever wonder what it would be like for a cheapskate to develop a game here it be 
a 6 but 0 to balance the people give ten Game be the good direction for pokemon I believe but need some polish work to do in the future 
many people be act like this be the next big step for pokemon but it ' not this be not the next generation of pokemon this be just some weird experimental game that add 7 new pokemon all of it ' new mechanic will be forget by the time the next pokemon game come out but perhaps that ' for the good as the new battle and capture mechanic be not fun on top of that the game have an embarrassingly low amount of pokemon even less than sword and shield the game also somehow look bad than sword and shield it ' like the game be make by amateur this game be also the reason the gen 4 remake be so bad as gamefreak the pokemon company put all their resource into this while outsource BDSP to some no name support studio legend arceus be a waste of everyone ' time and money skip this one 
boss battle be trash and unfair the main difficulty here be to jump around fast enough I don ' like such sh in a strategy rpg 
game look play like * * * * Nintendo can do well than this they re ask full price after all 
only good thing about this game be the new mechanic for catch Pokémon the world be large but completely empty so there be no reward or satisfaction from explore it the new battle system make any Pokémon that doesn ' have a high speed stat worthless the gameplay be extremely repetitive and tedious require you to grind the same task up to 25 time 
this game be an absolute cash grab visually mediocre which be a compliment after the unpolished sword and shield entry one of the bad pokemon plot I have see and try to compensate with some new evolution to old and classic pokemon like quilava and rowlett it ' time for the Pokemon franchise to step aside the gamefreak ' environment and get a dev team that make justice to what the pokemon franchise could bring to we in capable hand want to play an interesting and non cashgrab monster collector jrpg play Shin Megami Tensei and get a game that it ' worth your money if u have unlimited mommy and daddy fund and like the pokemon franchise you do you underwhelme game and disappointing entry once again but what ' new 
I ' disappoint barely any improvement from the two previous atrocity the map be a barren wasteland the game be infest with bug I ' do with this series I just realise I have be play this out of sheer nostalgia I ' rather spend my money play game where devs respect their fanbase 
they copy same house seven time for main village of the game not even change rotation at this point single game developer can make a well game they be just lazy and they know pokemon bias people go to buy their game anyway 
extremely disappointing technically the bad I have see in many year still it will sell more than anyone else 
this game be repetitive empty and as innovative as replace sliced bread with unsliced bread once again Pokemon fan be reward a low effort cash grab with heap of money and praise it ' time for the Pokemon franchise to catch up with the generation of gaming that come before the last one which they have still fail to do so any hope for the franchise to ever catch up to current gaming be nonexistent remember how good BOTW be Don ' forget that ' a wiiu game that be port to switch not an actual switch game six year later this be the garbage Pokemon come up with absolutely shameful 
it ' catastrophic graphism be ugly the gameplay be very boring the fight be not interesting it ' only throw a bag of dust on the Pokemon for ten minute really it ' a scam if this game be not a pokemon game the rating have be at 50 or less 
big piece of garbage this game be terrible in so many way battle be still turn base but with less complexity since many feature like item pokemon could wear be remove the graphic be absolutely terrible the game look like a PS2 Game Purple shiny rock 2D grass sprite and the bad looking water I have ever see furthermore you can literally count pixel everywhere you go the semi open world feel insanely empt Accept for tree rock and 2D grass there be nothing to see in almost every area Quest be just comlete list of repetetive boring stuff catch 25 Bidiza Catch 25 bidiza from behind Overall the game be what other studio would call a pre alpha not worth 60 buck or 50 or 40 
a low quality graphic for a 2006 game seem to play Metin 2 rendering problem purple spot around the world etc 
its bland ugly and boring as hell the bad pokemon game in history it feel like a bad fangame 
this Game be absolut bad one of the bad Games I ever play graphic be Trash the Gameplay be just awful the Story be a Joke and the balance dosen ' exist Worst Game I ever play on the Switch I hate everything about it 
People should really stop buy support the Pokémon game series it ' disgusting that they throw at we new game with the exact same flaw the previous one have and the poor imaginable quality regard graphic design and story 
what a ugly and repetitive game sorry the bad game open world with graphic from n64 or mobil game 
spend at least a cent on development the game be sell in huge number you can afford it 
Gamefreak shouldn ' have release a open world Pokémon until they be up to the task now I understand why their reticent to create a full 3d explorable Pokemon world they lack the technical experience for such job would be well if they contract an external developer or a joint development with let ' say Monolithsoft while the premise of the roam a Pokémon world be a dream come true it soon turn into a nightmare the technical shortcoming be too glaring and take you out of the experience Gamefreak be not know for develop graphical marvel but with game the graphical gap be too evident texture be one of the most poor I ’ve see on Switch and I have play a lot switch game some of they be beta prototype quality really bad shadow be blocky at the point you can see the pixel like they would come with prerendered blob instead and it could look well draw distance be abysmal you can see warp geometry a few meter from your character on top of that the memory management be awful not allow keep in memory far object that pop out nowhere draw distance for object NPC grass tree landscape be all terrible when compare to a game like Xenoblade Chronicles you will only end with a deep sadness I really want to like this game but technically it ' below deficient and can ' for the life of mine immerse in the game without think how good it would be in hand of a more capable developer 
grind grind grind grind boring quest bad graphic very bad animation I hope GameFreak see this Game as a mistake 
I have play every pokemon game that exist but I can not support this title or gamefreak any long despite be a crazy profitable franchise GF once again hire a random 8th grader to write a not new story full of contradiction incorrect lore and just awful dialogue despite be wildly profitable and a huge game developer GF once again spend 0 resource or time on graphic piece together a bare bone world patch together with mesh from microsoft paint and copy paste feature with little to no detail the concept be awesome and the potential here be really high and good but GF themselves spend little to no effort in develop good game and instead just throw out garbage wrap in a nice pokemon wrapping paper and people buy it up because of the franchise power this be honestly insulting to people who play video game and offensive to sell for 60 it look like it be make by someone who have 0 experience in code artwork or story writing and greenlit by a greedy executive just look for a paycheck 
its soo ugly this game somtime look like psx 1 game its 2022 this game look like 1999 game do not buy 
I have just finish the game this be a mayor disaster that never could tolerate by a big company like Game Freak and Nintendo A shame 
game be a awful cash grab imagine give a game that drop under 15 fps often a pass grade this game be bad look than some N64 game 
Gameplay be more repetitive than previous game NPC don ' even have voice acting make cutscene and conversation bore NPC grunt etc wild Pokemons be just walk mindlessly with no simple routine make the game feel more lifeless for example in Monster Hunter Stories 1 and 2 you can see monster sleep eat and in story 1 some monster like Velocipreys be go out hunt prey and it be a 3ds game graphic be horrendous in a game where 90 of the time you be walk out in the world at least make the world look decent it be bad than a 3ds game Character model be a total downgrade from Sword and Shield like how Imagine visual artist work in another game try to make their game look as pleasing as possible only for Pokemon re tart to say they work doesn ' matter because GrApIcHs ArEn ' eVeRyThInG I don ' say that Pokemon need 4 k ultra realistic visual all I m say be at least make it look well than fecke Wii game my big offender in this game be the animation Monster Hunter Stories 2 and SMT be proof that a monster collect game can have good animation Unsurprisingly Pokemon continue it trend to make sub par animation that feel robotic and unnatural just try compare mhst 2 animation to PLA TLDR in my offensive opinion * * * * game make by * * * * developer play by nostalgia blind fan who never play any other game than Pokemon 
a game make without love the gameplay be fun sometimes technically be a shame it be not even low graphic be a game badly do with poor technical decision 
this game have inexcusable graphic it look like they pull the blocky graphic from the original Roller Coaster Tycoon game I have see well graphic on GameCube it look soooooo bad I have conclude the devolper have no graphical talent 
too big for gamefreak there be some good idea here and there but very poorly execute graphic destroy and limit the whole experience a disaster a beta version of what it should be 
the graphic be unbelievable bad if you be ask yourself why this game get golden showered with 9 ' and 10 ' it ' the sign of the time it ' a sign the world be turn to * * * * 
between texture run at 240p horrible white artifact pop up whenever the game get dark bad draw distance and pop up and distant pokemon often run at 2fps this game be visually embarrass the battle aren ' cooler or different you can just move your character during they which be purely cosmetic sometimes you get 1v2 or 1v3 battle even against trainer but you can not send out another mon and theytook out aoe attack this feel like a f2p mmo from the early 2000 minus all of the other people 
as a game and creation of a saga as big as Pokémon that move million it be a great shame half do graphic half do animation 3 hour of tutorial Technical and artistic non existent open world Gamefreak have do it again and a mediocre game will once again sell a lot to a fandom without criterion 
I understand that Game Freak do not own all the money that the Pokémon trademark make I also understand that Nintendo do not have a say in how Game Freak make their game but I still understand that Breath of the Wild be release four year ago and look well than Arceus so the Hardware be not the Problem the very game that Arceus be try to copy for its mechanic and open world be four year old and yet somehow look well play well more story more heart more everything and 60 buck for this Desaster from Game Freak year after year we have to stop this 
the real problem of this game be not in the graphic which however be a problem but the problem lie in the very foundation of the game pass off as primary mission of the obvious fetch quest collectible classic in any other game be pure shame absolutely absent plot dialogue without a minimum of logic all in all a * * * * 
absolutely embarrass both technically and on gameplay level there may absolutely be some player who can like it but if this game didn ' have the name Pokemon it would be blast away with a lot of 4 5 
by far bad pokemon game I have ever play people complain about sword and shield and now praise this completly discuste 
I think it be safe to say that the Pokemon game Fan base have become a cult of sort at this point realise a game in this state and get praise by it be downright disgusting do not get scamme for this game this be a beta test for what could be somenthe way more polished do not get surprised if it take another 10 year for something actually worth while to get release thant you pokemon fan base 
it feel like a step in the right direction and I appreciate the idea to change the formula up but my god what a disaster of a rush game Repetetive mediorce gameplay embarassing visual with no save grace all the positive review have to be pay off no one in their right mind could possibly enjoy this game it feel like a tech demo from 2003 it ' not a complete game 
a very poor game Pokemon Legends Arceus break the traditional Pokemon formula that we all know and love the game feel very empty with almost no extra content a big disappointment overall 
the graphic be sh1tthe rest would be good legend Arceus as just a game without its franchise would definitely be mediocre it be a collect a thon with some QoL element a serviceable plot subpar graphic and a musical score which while charming be a bit too subtle in the overworld the fact that it have a full game price tag would definitely turn some people away 
this be not an open world nor be it a new attempt many Pokemon fan be try to overestimate the game say it have make a new attempt for Pokemon but I can ' give high score to these game just because Pokemon come out 
huge Pokemon Fan here in my opinion this game be one of the bad Pokemon game of all time I like the fact that they finally try out something new but Game Freak have fail the music be lame and boring the graphic be from 2004 Botw be from 2015 and look thousand time well the world be empty and very generic some place be just copy paste 
Best Pokemon ever without any doubt it ' beautiful graphic almost make I cry the open world look so full of life incredible detailed texture make with love lot of Pokemon have interesting interaction between they story and mechanic be the good of the franchise so far so many thing to do catch the same Pokemon again again and again and craft so many love put into the animation very cheap game only € 60 Etc it ' a must buy no other Pokemon game achieve this perfection 
the only way you can like this game be if you have never play another open world game there be a hundred well open world game with infinitely less budget 
I don ' recommend it to anyone all nice idea to renew the brand but none do well 
tragic graphic janky gameplay poor story bore repetitive quest awful effort at a open world game 
disappointment bring nothing new to the open world formula you be much well off with Breathe of the Wild shameless cash grab Gamefreak can not make a 3d pokemon game it ' extreme hand holding and too many filler cutscene my nickname for it be Pokemon Fetch quest 
this may be the most disappointing Pokemon game ever the graphic suck the entire overworld feel empty no town no city no Gyms no Elite 4 no champion no extra content like Contests Secret Bases or anything similar very very few trainer battle I don ' know what they be think 
a basic and bad copy of attack on Titan mix with Monster Hunters Game should be free to play with these graphic and this story tell it ' monster hunter but it cost 60 euro and be way less fun bad graphic and no entertaining mechanic please save your money and go download a fan make version of pokemon those actually have some story and fun to it 
very disappointed in this game this be the first game I buy on release day in over 5 year and be really excited about it for month ahead of time after about 15 hour I ’ve put the game away and have no real desire to pick it up again it be super repetitive and doesn ' even feel like a Pokémon game I ’ve have a total of 10 battle against other trainer at most and they all have like 1 Pokémon each to I Pokémon have always be about create a good team level they up and battle against other without the battle aspect I feel like there be no point to the game I don ' even remember what Pokémon I have in my party because I m not even create a battle team I just hold on to they and complete various research task level they up to evolve complete more research task and then cycle through other Pokémon it ' a shame to because this game introduce some wonderful battle mechanic like strong vs agile move the ability to switch out your move set outside of battle and then take battle away and make this a game all about catch Pokémon Might as well be Pokémon snap I ' very disappointed I spend money on this game I be already get nervous because of the time period it ' in and be tell there be no gym or Pokémon league but didn ' think they would eliminate the core of what be a Pokémon game and that ' create a team and battle against other team I should have wait and pass on this probably win ' even finish this only reason I might be because I hate leave game unfinished but frankly my time be way well spend with Sw Sh or BDSP until gen 9 come out 
as long the developer doesn ' suffer a huge sale failure they will continue to develop mediocre game do not support Game Freak Pokémon fan deserve more 
the same disappointment as every year very low quality and ugly graphic repetitive gameplay the same as always 
technically a ps2 game also a flat world that doesn ' have a soul Pokémon be png that walk completely random and also doesn ' interact with they they be in strage habitat like Hauter in the snow habitat or other stupid thing probably Game Freak should get help because this game be completely garbage 
I m not go to lie this Pokémon game look really bad the graphic be horrible but I over look all of that because this be the most fun iv have play a Pokémon game in a while this be a amazing step in the right direction and the story be pretty interesting so far its something different I m no long a 10 yr old go on the same journey I m a teenager who be in a new world be it the good story no but then again I wasn ' expect naughty dog story tell level I honestly wasn ' even expect to be into the story at all the last Pokémon game I follow the story with be and and black and white 1 2 look at the review for a few past Pokémon game sword and shield brilliant diamond and shine pearl this have be the well review Pokémon game in a long time there be plenty of new surprise in this game and I will not spoil anything if you don ' care about graphic at all then this Pokémon game be for you other than the weak weak weak graphic this Pokémon game be a easy 7 5 we need to stop try to make excuse for game freak this company make too much money to put out game that look like a launch ps3 game if breath of the wild Splatoon 2 Mario odyssey Metroid new Pokémon snap and pokken can look amazing on switch so can future Pokémon game maybe we don ' need a new Pokémon game every year I would be cool wait a while for another game if it mean a more polished well look experience also tell I game freak be not good with make 3 game be not a excuse hire talent that be good at make 3 game pokemon be a billion dollar IP other than my gripe with the graphic its a fun Pokémon game the most fun iv have in year from a pokemon game find new thing and see new evolution for be exciting 
despite have good idea and be the first innovative pokemon game in the last 10 year its graphic be the least of its problem this game be an insult to the player it treat u af if u have 3 year old the dialogue be pathetic and despite have a very simple and very easy to understand it have more that 3h of tutorial without let u explore the world or do anything freely I just hope next pokemon game will do something at least acceptable with the core idea of this game 
play like a over price mobile game not very many pokemon and less battle even Sword and shield be well all they do be recycle old pokemon into a game we be ur suppose to research they like there something new the game be significantly short then any of the other pokemon game 
it doesn ' have SQUIRTLE how can a POKEMON game be launch without simply have the good pokemon in the game this be disrespectful 
a 7 but 0 to balance with people give it 10 Fun game but boring after a few hour bad graphic and boring music 
a great idea execute poorly with so many other gorgeous game avaliable on the switch it stand to reason a game by Gamefreak should look at least similar instead it barely hide its stuttering fps issue and subpar graphic with the collecting of pokemon its have throughout its series the new gameplay be stunt by the glaring issue the game have at its foundation the fundamental flaw be lack of variety when all be say and do there be no replayability to this game after finish the pokedex there be no multiplayer battle no rebattle trainer no new pokemon after complete the regional dex no breeding mechanic and no other goal leave ehat you have leave be a barren world rife with monster you ve already have catch over and over which bring I back to the flaw of lack of variety a measly 242 pokemon to catch with the small amount of actual battle you get to experience reduce your option for actually use your pokemon to only a few instance you will be see your mount more than you will ever see your own pokemon in battle another aspect that I find irritating be the amount of design take straight from breath of the wild from its menu option to its game hud it end up emulate a much well game as if to remind you you could be play that instead it try so hard to be something it wasn ' to begin with and then trip over itself in presentation 
bad pokemon game I ve ever play its a catch simulator with barely any battle * * * * graphics horrible fps issue and rendering of asset in the game from barely 10 foot away from I I have see playstation 2 game with well graphic and hardware be not the problem look at BotW and Xenoblade and Monster Hunter on the switch way well and on the same system Lazy devs milk the pokemon name for money they do not even have online pokemon battle or barely any battling in the game at all to be frank 
if you like catch pokemon this os your game but if you like fight just don ' buy this game 
es lamentable que una de las franquicias que más dinero genera saque a la venta un juego así Es inadmisible que solo por ser Pokémon haya que conformarse con un juego mediocre que no aporta nada más allá de un estilo de juego a lo Monster Hunter que no es realmente un mundo abierto no están inventando nada que no haya ya sacrificando un apartado gráfico lleno de pop bug que es peor que el de Wii un apartado sonoro repetitivo e inexistente en algunos casos La historia flojita con unos diálogos que no llevan a ninguna parte puesto que la elección del diálogo es una falsa ilusión con personajes inexpresivos sin gancho Un juego con poca dificultad mucho texto cuyo mundo abierto resulta vacío con un pueblo lleno de casas copiadas pegadas la innovación en el sistema de juego está bien pero no sacrificando todo lo demás El juego es disfrutable si es el camino que van a seguir los próximos juegos de Pokémon estará bien siempre cuando no repitan los errores de este gráficos diálogo dificultad etc Es un éxito solo porque los fans de Pokémon nos conformamos con cualquier basura no debería ser así desde el punto de vista de consumidor deberíamos exigir más it be unfortunate that one of the franchise that generate the most money release such a game it be inadmissible that just because it be a Pokémon you have to settle for a mediocre game that do not contribute anything beyond a Monster Hunter style game which be not really an open world and they be not invent anything that do not already exist sacrifice a section graphic full of pop bug and what be bad than the Wii a repetitive and non existent sound section in some case the weak story with dialogue that lead nowhere since the choice of dialogue be a false illusion with inexpressive character and without a hook a game with little difficulty and a lot of text whose open world be empty with a town full of copy and paste house the innovation in the game system be fine but not sacrifice everything else the game be enjoyable and if it be the path that the next Pokémon game be go to follow it will be fine as long as they do not repeat the error of this one graphic dialogue difficulty etc it ' a success only because Pokémon fan settle for any garbage and it shouldn ' be like that from the point of view of the consumer we should demand more 
always try to make something completely different and sell it by the name they put on it let ' break it down if you change everything about something can you still call it the same thing let ' say I artificially produce an orange when you see it it look like an orange but as you begin to peel it you notice that it ' green on the inside and instead of be juicy and squishy it ' crisp like an apple and taste like a jalapeno so you assume it be an orange by the surface without delve deeply in and create an opinion so now I ask how many of you would still call this monstrosity an orange because I certainly would not this have be the same scenario with most switch game you people be to skiddish to say you dislike something in today ' society or you be just not prone to think for yourself and let the medium and other outside information strongly influence your opinion 
battle be boring and the exploration be very lackluster Clearly Nintendo have ship out here and it ' go to be the second version that would probably be worth play 
graphic be unbelievable bad and the gameplay be repedetive you‘re just run from qu marker top quest marker 
terrible game visual be horrible the world be barren and dry People only say this game be good because it ' a step forward but if game freak can ' put in the effort to make a good game there be no point buy any future Pokémon game until they do they know that anything with Pokémon in the title will sell Trust I I really want to like this game but with all these issue and bug I can not to have a game release in 2022 to look bad than game release on launch with switch I can not support a game that look like the world have be through 4 nuclear winter 
this game have bad graphic bad design boring grind f loop this be embarrassing for the most popular franchise in the world what ' the point in grow Pokémon if there aren ' any trainer it ' a grind f in an ugly environment no music voice acting or story the good lava and water graphic ever almost well than sea of thieves GAMEFREAK make a money GRAB 
quite the different Pokemon game from the main line series however this be one of the good Pokemon gaming experience I have ever have 10 10 100 would recommend to fan of the franchise 
final boss be too cheap that be not fail at all it ' not beyond type it insult 
boss fight aren ' think out properly too many bug and sloppy development 
not open world and kinda boring graphic be pretty bad the beginning of the game have a ton of dialog 
questo gioco e fantastico e rivoluzionario e ciò che sempre desiderare e sperare 
semplicemente il migliore Pokemon di sempre divertente immersivo e innovativo per il serie 
il gioco mi essere piacere tanto il grafica non essere granché e ci essere di zona spoglia ma tutto sommare il gameplay ti intrattiene 
Dei migliore gioco Pokémon fino a oggi potere ottenere poco punto negativiAdoro giocare ci con mio figlia di 6 anno ci divertare così tanto 
il nuovo introduzione open World style di gameplay in uno gioco pokemon prendere il sopravvento tale da non fartare stancare mai di giocare Storia avvincente mistero da scoprire e ottimo quantità di contenuto questo dovere essere il futuro di il serie 
uno gioco con uno atmosfera unico essere il rinascita e il futuro di il serie Pokemon essere uno veterano avere iniziare con il primo Pokemon rosso e blu con Pokemon arceus avere rivissere il stesso entusiasmo che non provare da il primo titolo 
Ottimo gioco uno grande ritorno per me Non giocavare a Pokemon da il tempo di Smeraldo questo avventura nonostante qualche limitazione grafico essere per me straordinariamente appassionante Gameplay stratificare si coniugare a uno game Loop sempre stimolante iL stile di il titolo e ’ ambientazione fare da contorno a uno ottimo rappresentazione di il pokemon e di il loro mosso che essere tutto animare a dovere il scarsezza grafico a tratto non inficiare ’ atmosfera il storia essere intrigante come anche il personaggio 
cosa essere leggenda Arceus se non uno titolo bello perché piace avere trascorrere a Hisui bene 55 ora che personalmente rivivrei da capo comparto audio fenomenale animazione e character design godibile in uno mondo che per quanto spoglio andare bene così per quello che si essere porre A non essere apprezzare il sezione con il gene il morto a caso causare da Braviary e specialmente ' introduzione che potere risultare scomoda e noioso per chi già avere intuire il meccanico 
più vicino a il 9 che a il 8 perché il grafica essere bene lontano da qualsiasi sufficienza ma da appassionato sempre più distaccare questo gioco davvero mi avere lasciare immergere desiderare di finire il pokedex e il quest secondario in maniera sincera Gameplay davvero coinvolgente che riuscire a scavalcare il enorme e ovvi problema tecnico sperare in uno futuro per questo serie e uno collaborazione con studio esterno per colmare questo lacuno 
ottimo titolo gamefreak avere intraprendere il strada giusto avere ancora evidente ilacun tecnica ma il gameplay prendere molto e diverto sperare essere uno nuovo buono inizio per il brandGrafica 6Sonoro 8Trama 7 5Giocabilità 8 5Longevità 8 5 
il via verso uno nuovo pokemon essere giusto ma servire più tempo per produrre uno gioco appagante graficamente a mio parere servirebbero più anno di sviluppo ma essere su il buono strada 
a il inizio mi avere spiazzare uno po da fan di il serie ma adesso ci pattere ora e ora 
gioco molto bello a livello di gameplay e di innovazione ma peccare per il lato tecnico il grafica fare pena ma il gameplay essere molto bello 
8 per eccesso perché essere più uno 7 5 gameplay soddisfacente che catturare e invoglia a continuare il storia trama carino ma che potere andare uno po più in il dettaglio il grafica invece lasciare veramente a desiderare e in certo momento ci si chiedere il perchè di certo scelta Probabilmente bisognare dedicare almeno 1 altro anno di sviluppo 
non il gioco di il anno ma sicuramente uno buono base da cui iniziare uno nuovo ciclo 
uno di il migliore gioco per ps2 A parte il scherzo semplicemente orrere a livello tecnico e fare ridere come YouTubers e sito di recensione lo diare 8 9 10 uno cosa di il genere in il 2022 essere inammissibile continuare a darglio corda tanto Gamefreak si adagiare su il allorio fare sempre il minimo indispensabile e sembrare che tutto essere felice tristo sapere che vendere perché essere Pokemon e non perché essere uno gioco valido almeno su gameplay e storia essere mettere meglio rispetto a il ultimo capitolo e in generale mi son piaciere molto più libertà e sentire uno mondo uno po’ più vivo rispetto a prima almeno da quando essere passare a il 3d comunque per me Bocciato non meritare di esistere uno gioco così ma tanto vendare così tanto a il gente piacere il merda 
Scandaloso come in il 2022 ci essere persona che non si lamentiare di il lavoro tecnico fare con Arceus ma ' importante essere il gameplay non il grafica si ma qui parlare di uno bassezza unico che neanche a il tempo di il DS ' essere Switch potere permettere si di fare girare uno determinato grafico Zelda ne essere il prova ma qui si parlare di pigrizia bello e buono e non DEVE essere perdonare dare che il caro Nintendo chiedere almeno 60 euro per giocare a il suo gioco e non abbassare il prezzo cosi facilmente 
a livello tecnico credere essere uno di il truffa più grosso da il tempo di Cyberpunk Texture che non si caricare pure essere a uno qualità infimo frame rato che passare magicamente da il 20 fps a il 5 quando volere Gameplay ripetitivo contenuto inesistente menù ideare da chi non sapere cosa voglia dire fare uno menu Ti tenere incollato perché infore ci si potere anche divertire ma non essere possibile in il 2022 su il console che avere fare girare BOTW ormai anno fa avere uno livello tecnico così infimo Spero si sveglinare perché se no essere mettere davvero male Pokemon così non andare bene 
uno scandaloso gioco tecnicamente di inizio 2000 gameplay semplice ma non noioso trovare scandaloso però che uno azienda che fattura miliardo e con questo numero di vendita uno prodotto di il genere lo trovare inaccetabile 
sembrare uno gioco di il 2010 a il pari di Metin2 ovviamente 60 € essere uno follia Quando costare quanto uno gioco da smartphone perché a quello livello essere se non meno allora meriterà di essere acquistare

sem sombra de dúvida o bom aventura de Pokémon desde o era Game Boy . Vale o pena curtir e jogar o jogo em todo o missão e sidequests . vale um 80h tranquilamente 
"jogo incrível , como fã de o franquia ser um grande salto de qualidade , poder explorar o mundo de maneira livre e com novo mecânica . "
"Inovador , jogo incrível em o meu opinião revolucionar o mecânica de jogo de o pokemon , que ter mais jogo em esse modelo "
jogo fantástico . experiência que todo pessoa querer desde que lançar pokemon . História boa . Gráficos de o cenário meio ruim mas de o pokemon ser fantástico . jogabilidade ser experiência perfeito . ter 29 ano e eu apaixonar por o jogo de o monstrinho 
"bom jogo pokemonr desde o black in white , esperar que esse novo gameplay ser levar em o proximo jogo de o franquia , parabéns game freak ! "
"um de o bom jogo de pokemon que já jogueir , apesar de o história ser curto , o que ser algo já habitual em o jogo pokemon , para capturar o Boss Final ( arceu ) ter de completar o pokedex , ou ser , levar muito , muito tempo , passar o jogo em 60 hora . "
"отличный игра ! геймплей стать разнообразный , нет этот коридорный путешествие и тренер - соперник , стоить у каждый угол . Чаще всего скучный и проходной битва с гим - лидер заменить на интересный битва с босс . добавить куча активность : мини - игра , временной разлом , поиск сокровище , крафт , поиск потерять вещь другими игрок , спот с покемон , где можно нарваться на шайника . графика , да , это минус , но она соответсвует стилистика , а игра и правда очень стильная в свой минималистичности . но игра про покемон никогда и не были про графика , а про геймплей . а он здесь очень медитативный и приятный ! очень советую - реально новый свежий взгляд на уже застояться на один и тот же серия игра . "
"Круто ловить покемон в открытый мир , но к сожаление быть графический артефакт и не высокий разрешение . самый главный минус отсутствовать русский язык . нинтендо пожалуйста добавить русский язык!it 's cool to catch pokemon in the open world , but unfortunately there are graphic artifacts and low resolution . the most important disadvantage is the absence of the russian language . nintendo please add russian ! "
